  <h1>A Quick System Announcement</h1>

  <p>As some of you may already know, the Level Up: Advanced 5th Edition system recently
    transitioned to being a community managed project! A lot has changed behind the scenes, so I
    thought it would be a good idea to give everyone a short update.</p>

  <p>Before anyone panics, there have been no changes to the core development team, and our plans
    for the future haven't changed either.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>The Community Discord Server 🎉</h2>

    <p>First of all, we now have a community Discord server, where you can get help with the system,
      provide feedback, and keep up to date with system development. It's not all business though,
      and
      if you just want to come and chat about tabletop games, we'd love to have you!</p>

    <p>
      You can find a link to the Discord server <a

      >here</a>!

    <h2>Compendia! 📚</h2>

    <p>The system now has a number of compendia, which you can find in the compendium tab of the
      right
      sidebar. Creating the compendia has been a big community effort over the past week or so, with
      some work starting long before that.</p>

    <p>The initial packs provided with the system are mostly Narrator-focused, as the greatest
      configuration burden is usually on our beloved game masters. More packs will come in the
      coming
      days as further work is completed.</p>

    <p>Please be patient while we work to improve the compendia throughout the 0.6 branch. If you
      notice any errors or missing information, you can report them in <a
        href="https://discord.gg/XtkZ6RkN9E"
        rel=“nofollow”
        target="_blank"
      >our community Discord server</a> or on the <a

    <h2>Funding 💰</h2>

    <p>Finally, I just want to say a quick word about funding.</p>

    <p>In addition to being a community managed project, the system is now a community
      <em>developed</em>
      project, meaning that all of the work on the system is being done by volunteers. If
      you're enjoying the system, or you want to support its continued development, please consider
      donating to my <a
