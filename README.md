This is an official FoundryVTT system implementation for Level Up: Advanced 5th Edition. The system is currently released as part of an open beta, but it's fully game ready for those of your itching to play Level Up online.

The system currently has dedicated sheets for both PCs and NPCs, both of which feature various pieces of helpful automation, including roll buttons and resource tracking.

Make sure to update regularly, as new features are currently being added all the time!

## Modules

In addition to the wealth of system agnostic modules available on Foundry, several modules have already been made specifically for Level Up. You can find a list of these packages below.

If you've developed a module for the Level Up system and would like it listed here, feel free to get in touch. You can find several ways to contact me in the `system.json`, or you can open a ticket if you'd prefer.

- [A5E DragRuler Integration](https://github.com/NekroDarkmoon/a5edragruler) - A Level Up integration for the Drag Ruler module, adding support for movement rules specific to Level Up.
- [A5E Utility Helpers](https://github.com/NekroDarkmoon/a5e-utility-helpers) - A small module to provide helper functions for use in the A5E System.
- [Concentrator](https://github.com/NekroDarkmoon/a5e-concentrator) - This module adds the concentration condition and automates the application of the effect on the use of a spell that requires concentration. Taking damage prompts the GM or the player to roll for a concentration check and removes the effect if the save isn't successful.
- [Does it hit!?](https://github.com/NekroDarkmoon/does-it-hit-a5e) - A module to help with hit detection and limited damage automation.

**Compatibility Note:** Level Up is not based on the 5e system implementation in Foundry and 5e-specific modules should not be expected to work.
