Other cities of the dead are the seats of power for certain wicked empires, holy cities reconsecrated to profane powers, and the great cultural centers of the Shadowfell (such as Unknown Kadath on the dread Plateau of Leng). Others still were once the un-beating hearts of magocracies ruled by necromancers and fed by the tyrannized masses.</p><p>The people of the necropolis vary wildly. Every kind of mortal can be found here, practicing any manner of lifestyle as what might be expected in the metropolis&mdash;but imbued with brutality and cynicism befitting the night creatures which call this city home. The role of undead in the necropolis also varies. In some cities, night creatures are the de facto rulers. In other cases the undead represent a kind of military occupation, and the living of the city feel compelled to tolerate their dread presence while conspiring to oust them.</p><h3>Necropolitan Traits</h3><p>Characters raised in the necropolitan culture share a variety of traits in common with one another.</p><p><strong>Dark Diplomacy.</strong> You gain proficiency with your choice of Deception, Intimidation, Investigation, Sleight of Hand, or Stealth.</p><p><strong>Familiarity with Undead.</strong> You have proficiency with the Arcana skill and you gain the Undead skill expertise.</p><p><strong>Necropolitan Magic.</strong> You know the chill touch cantrip. At 3rd level, you can either false life or inflict wounds once between long rests. At 5th level, you can cast either invisibility or ray of enfeeblement once between long rests. Your spellcasting ability for these is your choice of Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma.</p><p><strong>Urban Denizen.</strong> You know your way around big cities, and know how to find people in urban locations. You can make an Investigation check to learn the location of (or at the Narrator&rsquo;s discretion gain a helpful clue to the trail of) a person by discreetly asking around in the right places. The difficulty of the check is DC 15 if the individual is not hiding, or DC 20 if they are trying to conceal their location.</p><p><strong>Undead Contact.</strong> You gain an extra contact, selected from a background of your choice. This person is Undead (the Narrator determines what variety).</p><p><strong>Languages.</strong> You can speak, read, write, and sign Common, plus two others.</p>","grants":{"SLo8z5tLJFO88QM5":{"grantType":"feature","label":"Culture Features","features":{"base":[{"uuid":"Compendium.a5e.a5e-culture-features.Item.j8oee9gauwn2sgg1","limitedReselection":true,"selectionLimit":1},{"uuid":"Compendium.a5e.a5e-culture-features.Item.1855eqpqsz3lezig","limitedReselection":true,"selectionLimit":1},{"uuid":"Compendium.a5e.a5e-culture-features.Item.vbrjbmrk75ebkbfa","limitedReselection":true,"selectionLimit":1},{"uuid":"Compendium.a5e.a5e-culture-features.Item.a2y03an1q1a2jqgm","limitedReselection":true,"selectionLimit":1},{"uuid":"Compendium.a5e.a5e-culture-features.Item.rh8v99cvpqq650d5","limitedReselection":true,"selectionLimit":1}],"options":[],"total":0}},"r5XsgcfOrP3Bx6py":{"grantType":"trait","traits":{"traitType":"languages","base":["common"],"options":["abyssal","aquan","auran","celestial","common","deep","draconic","druidic","dwarvish","elvish","giant","gnoll","gnomish","goblin","grimlock","halfling","ignan","infernal","minotaur","mycelial","orc","primordial","sylvan","terran","cant","undercommon"],"total":2},"label":"Languages"}},"source":"moarComplete"},"effects":[],"flags":{},"_id":"8co5h30hr2bwhtkn"}

They are austere and militaristic, believing that strength is honor. This belief no doubt comes from the tribe&rsquo;s history, where they had to wrest their freedom from the hands of ancient giant tyrants&mdash;which required every ounce of determination they could muster. Even though goliath communities do include true giants and other humanoids, such people must prove themselves &ldquo;worthy&rdquo; to be called equals. Seasonal rites of the goliath (which also serve as rites of passage) include pilgrimage to dangerous crags, mud-wrestling tournaments, and raids against true giant encampments. Some goliath enclaves are radically egalitarian, while others gravitate around their strongest warrior who they declare chieftain&mdash;which method is &ldquo;stronger&rdquo; and &ldquo;more honorable&rdquo; is an open question among the people.</p><p>For the goliath, it is critical always to project individual strength&mdash;and to cultivate strength within the tribe. They believe war is always at hand, and wearing anything less than leather or hide armor in public is considered a state of embarrassing undress. (By contrast, they do not consider it immodest for functional armor to leave skin exposed.) While the stricture of a &ldquo;marriage contract&rdquo; is considered dishonorable among the goliath, many consider life-long relations with one or more partners and raising children to be obvious signs of strong character. The goliath believe that educating every child in their midst is critical in cultivating a tribe of strong individuals. Their schools&nbsp;are informal and managed by volunteers. The basic curriculum includes history, values, music &amp; song, crafting, hunting, and mountain climbing.</p><p>By counterpoint, the goliath see weakness as the sign&nbsp;of dishonor. Although this value comes from the need to defend the tribe from the tyranny of giants, these days it can lead the goliath to treat people in need with disdain. Patience is considered a sign of strength... but charitable souls must draw a line between &ldquo;restoring someone their strength&rdquo; and &ldquo;enabling dishonorable conduct.&rdquo; Granting mercy to an enemy is thought to be, through the goliath moral calculus, a form of child abuse. Speech among the goliath is not free; people without the strength to defend their beliefs are expected to remain silent. Anyone expressing controversial opinions must be both articulate and fierce as to defend themselves in the ensuing debate and wrestling challenges.</p><h3>Goliath Traits</h3><p>Characters raised in the goliath culture share a variety of traits in common with one another.</p><p><strong>Acclimatized. </strong>You have resistance to cold damage.

This stacks with the AC provided by a shield.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sharp-Tooth</strong>&mdash;Fanged tyrants like allosaurus and spinosaurus. You have a bite attack, a natural weapon dealing 1d8 piercing damage. (Your bite uses Strength for attack and damage rolls. This is not an unarmed strike.) Some adherents of this path have a pronounced&mdash;even exaggerated&mdash;jawline or underbite.</p></li><li><p><strong>Thunderer</strong>&mdash;Herbivorous titans like diplodocus and brontosaurus.
