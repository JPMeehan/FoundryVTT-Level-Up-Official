At 1st level you gain a soldiering knack of your choice. Your soldiering knacks are listed below. The Knacks Known column of the Fighter table shows when you learn more fighter soldiering knacks.</p><h2>Amphibious Combatant</h2><p>You gain a swim speed equal to your Speed, and you can spend 1 exertion to reroll a failed Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution check related to aquatic activity (such as an Athletics check to swim, an Acrobatics check to keep balance on a ship&rsquo;s deck, or a Constitution check to hold your breath). You may choose whether to use the new roll or the original. In addition, you add your proficiency bonus to the number of minutes you can hold your breath before suffocating, and you can spend 1 exertion to hold your breath for additional minutes equal to your proficiency bonus.</p><h2>Burst of Strength</h2><p>You can spend 1 exertion to add your proficiency bonus to a Strength check, even if you already add your proficiency bonus to the check.</p><h2>Campaigner</h2><p>You double your Strength score when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can lift, push, or drag. In addition, you can add your proficiency bonus to the number of hours you can march before you risk fatigue from a forced march.</p><h2>Clearsight Sentinel</h2><p>You gain darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. In addition, you don&rsquo;t suffer disadvantage on Perception checks in lightly obscured areas (such as in light fog, moderate foliage, or heavy precipitation).</p><h2>Extreme Leap</h2><p>When you take the Dash action and mow at least 20 feet, your long jump distance is doubled until the end of your turn. You can spend 1 exertion to triple your jump distance until the end of your turn instead. If you do, you can move the full distance of your jump, even if it exceeds your Speed.</p><h2>Mountaineer</h2><p>You gain a climb speed equal to your Speed, and you can spend 1 exertion to reroll a failed Athletics check to climb, choosing whether to use the new roll or the original. In addition, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement.</p><h2>Nightwatch</h2><p>When taking a long rest, add your proficiency bonus to the number of hours you can spend in light activity. In addition, one hour of that time can be spent in strenuous activity near the rest site (such as patrolling, fighting, or other adventuring activities) without interrupting your rest.</p><h2>Stable Footing</h2><p>You have advantage on checks and saving throws to avoid falling prone. You never fall prone after falling, and when calculating damage you take from falling, treat the fall distance as if it were shorter by a number of feet equal to 10 &times; your proficiency bonus.</p><h2>Weather Beaten</h2><p>You gain advantage on saving throws against cold and hot weather, as well as any adverse effects from wind or precipitation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>","favorite":false,"secretDescription":"","source":"adventurersGuide","uses":{"value":0,"max":"","per":"","recharge":{"formula":"1d6","threshold":6}},"concentration":false,"featureType":"class","grants":{"xzBZxRehHDffJmiK":{"grantType":"feature","level":1,"levelType":"class","optional":false,"label":"Soldiering

{"name":"Schematics","type":"feature","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","system":{"ac":{"baseFormula":"","formula":"","grantsDisadvantage":false,"maxDex":0,"minStr":0,"mode":2,"requiresNoShield":false,"requiresUnarmored":false},"actions":{},"description":"<p>Starting at 2nd level, you can build all manner of things with the right tools, materials, and most importantly the schematics of what you’re trying to make.</p><h3><strong>Schematic Book </strong></h3><p>You gain schematics for three common rarity magic items of your choice (see Chapter 9: Enchanted Gear in Trials &amp; Treasures). A schematic is a collection of notes and diagrams that explains in detail how to create a specific magic item. These form your schematic book, and any future schematics you gain are added to it.</p><h3><strong>Crafting With Schematics</strong></h3><p>When you have the schematics for a magic item, they gain advantage on crafting checks to make it and the time required for crafting it is halved. Crafting a magic item using a schematic does not use up the schematic in any way, and the schematic remains usable. In addition, while using a schematic the quality of a mundane item required to make a magic item is reduced by one step.</p><h3><strong>Creating New Schematics</strong></h3><p>You can attempt to create and add a new schematic to your schematic book by spending 1 hour studying a magic item and gold equal to 1/10th of that item’s cost in experiments and material tests. At the end of the hour make an Engineering check (DC equal to item’s crafting DC). On a success you create a new schematic of that magic item and add it to your schematic book, and on a failure the time and materials are wasted.</p><p>Alternatively, if you find a schematic for a magic item you can add it to your schematic book.</p><p>To add a schematic to your schematic book or to create a schematic of a magic item, you must meet the minimum level requirements as if you were crafting the item (as shown on the Crafting and Minimum Player Level table on page 349 in Trials &amp; Treasures).</p><h3><strong>Replacing Your Schematic Book</strong></h3><p>The knowledge in your schematic book is too complex to keep entirely memorized, and if it is destroyed or lost you can’t reproduce it. For this reason most artificers fiercely protect their schematic books and many write copies. You can copy a schematic from your own schematic book into another book. This is just like creating a new schematic only significantly faster and easier since you already understand your own notations. You need only spend 10 minutes and 1 gold for each of your own schematics you copy into another book, or to create new schematics for a magic item you currently have infused.</p><h3><strong>Infusion</strong></h3><p>Once you have sufficiently studied a magic item you can reproduce and temporarily infuse its magical properties into items through arcano-technical ingenuity. If you have the schematic for a magic item, you can use an action to infuse it, turning a mundane item into the magic item from your schematic.</p><p>An infusion only works on mundane items specific to the type of magic item. For example, an infusion using a schematic for a magic longsword can only be used on a nonmagical longsword, and an infusion using a schematic for a suit of light armor can only be used on a nonmagical suit of padded cloth or padded leather. Many magic items take the form of small trinkets, baubles, and gems that can often be interchangeable, but the infused item needs to only be similar to the magic item’s description. The Narrator determines whether or not an item is suitable for an infusion.</p><p>You can infuse a number of items as shown on the Infusion Limit column of the Artificer table. You regain all expended infusion uses whenever you finish a long rest. </p><p>If an infused item requires attunement, you can attune yourself or another willing creature to it when you infuse the item. If you or another creature decide to attune to the item later, you must do so using the normal process for attunement. </p><p>Any infusions you imbue vanish after you finish a long rest, but they can remain imbued indefinitely if you commit to regular upkeep. Whenever you finish a long rest you can maintain any infused items you have access to by expending one infusion use for each. Any infusions you fail to maintain vanish and revert to mundane items. </p>","favorite":false,"secretDescription":"","source":"gpg0","uses":{"value":0,"max":"","per":"","recharge":{"formula":"1d6","threshold":6}},"concentration":false,"featureType":"class","grants":{},"prerequisite":"","requiresBloodied":false,"schemaVersion":{"version":0.019,"lastMigration":{"version":{"schema":0.018,"foundry":"11.315","system":"0.18.11"}}},"classes":""},"effects":[],"flags":{},"folder":null,"_id":"qgjbangzwrpldex1"}

Once per long rest while sleeping or trancing, you may ritually cast one of the spells in your journal. Each time you gain a witch level, you may add another ritual spell you know to the list. In addition, you always have the dream spell prepared, it does not count against the number of prepared spells, and you may ritually cast it even though it does not have the ritual tag, but only while you are sleeping or trancing.</p><h3>Coven Casting</h3><p>You may link two other creatures while ritual casting.

Whenever any creature lights this candle, they gain benefits as if they had ritually cast the spell.</p><p>A candle will burn for the duration of the spell contained within, and while burning cannot be put out by non-magical means.

When you cast the spell, you can choose one of the normal forms for your familiar or one of the following special forms: imp, pseudodragon, quasit, sprite, or any Tiny creature of CR 1/2 or less. You can also opt for the spirit you call forth to be an aberration, elemental, or undead.</p><p>When you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your familiar to make one attack of its own with its reaction. Additionally, when you use @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.5miit65bic46eynl]{Eldritch Scythe}, you can choose to deliver the attack through your familiar as though you had cast a spell with a range of Touch.</p><h2>Pact of the Tome</h2><p>Aware of your drive for knowledge, you awaken to find a grimoire left in your pack by your patron: a Book of Shadows. Choose three cantrips. While the book is in your possession, you know these cantrips and they are treated as warlock spells. They don&rsquo;t count against your number of cantrips known. If you lose your Book of Shadows, you can perform a 1 hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony destroys the previous book. The book is collected by your patron when you die.</p>","favorite":false,"secretDescription":"","source":"adventurersGuide","uses":{"value":0,"max":"","per":"","recharge":{"formula":"1d6","threshold":6}},"concentration":false,"featureType":"class","grants":{"xISC8gdgBRaRSkZf":{"grantType":"feature","level":1,"levelType":"character","optional":false,"label":"Pact Boon","features":{"total":1,"options":[{"uuid":"Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.6co2rqjh9npjg3eb","limitedReselection":true,"selectionLimit":1},{"uuid":"Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.f2mfiz8spijbzs6h","limitedReselection":true,"selectionLimit":1},{"uuid":"Compendium.a5e.a5e-class-features.Item.2dp9b4a11fuxjwbc","limitedReselection":true,"selectionLimit":1}],"base":[]}}},"prerequisite":"","requiresBloodied":false,"schemaVersion":{"version":0.019,"lastMigration":{"version":{"schema":0.018,"foundry":"11.315","system":"0.18.11"}}},"classes":""},"folder":null,"_id":"9m8p73ihwnicm2zi"}

If you violate the behavioral strictures of your virtue, you immediately lose the benefits from it until 24 hours after you finish a long rest and rededicate yourself. Choose one of the following options:</p><p></p><h3><strong>Chastity</strong></h3><p>You pledge to either celibacy or a committed, lifelong monogamous relationship. In return, you are harder to manipulate. You gain a skill specialty from the Insight skill and add your choice of your Wisdom or Charisma modifier to saves against the Charmed condition.</p><p></p><h3><strong>Temperance</strong></h3><p>You commit yourself to the avoidance of intoxicants and live a life of moderation. In exchange, your body is able to fight off toxins and disease more effectively. You add your Wisdom or Charisma modifier to saves against diseases and effects that would impose the Poisoned condition on you..</p><p></p><h3><strong>Charity</strong></h3><p>You commit to a life of generosity and as a result, find others willing to help you in your hour of need. Any income or treasure you have is automatically reduced by 10% (with an amount equal to the reduction going to charities and faith organizations of your choosing). Up to once per month, you can secure a night of free room and board for yourself and a number of companions equal to your proficiency bonus. At the Narrator’s option, you may be able to receive other benefits with this lodging, such as free or discounted medical care or being hidden from authorities who are looking for you.</p><p></p><h3><strong>Diligence</strong></h3><p>You commit yourself to a life of faithful service and labor, and, in exchange, can draw upon deeper wells of strength than most. You must spend at least as many downtime hours on the Work activity as anything else. In addition, you only receive half the usual amount of pay (at your discretion, you may receive less) because some of your work is done on behalf of a faith or charitable organization on a volunteer basis. Your exertion pool increases by 2.</p><p></p><h3><strong>Kindness</strong></h3><p>You forgo the luxury of treating others harshly, even when you <em>really</em> want to, and in exchange have additional healing power at your disposal. You must always accept a surrender when it is offered, you may never engage in torture (physical or psychological), and if you even raise your voice at another creature you must apologize. Your healing pool increases to 4x your level.</p><p></p><h3><strong>Patience</strong></h3><p>You commit yourself to enduring hardships without complaint. If something negative, but non-life-threatening (yours or others’) only affects you, you simply put up with it. You will not attempt to cut in lines, get out of unpleasant chores, take shelter from uncomfortable but non-dangerous weather, and so on. In exchange, you possess extraordinary self-control. As a bonus action or as a reaction to a condition being imposed on you, you can cast <em>calm emotions</em> without a spell slot, targeting yourself. Once you have used this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.</p><p></p><h3><strong>Humility</strong></h3><p>You look out for others before looking out for yourself. If someone else in your group of companions is in worse shape than you (lower percentage of their total hit points remaining or has more conditions than you) you may not take actions to heal yourself until they are in better condition than you are. This toughens you and makes you more resilient. You can travel at a forced march pace for an additional 2 hours without needing to make Constitution saving throws, and your carrying capacity is treated as if your Strength score was a point higher than it is.</p>","favorite":false,"secretDescription":"","source":"motifClasses","uses":{"value":0,"max":"","per":"","recharge":{"formula":"1d6","threshold":6}},"concentration":false,"featureType":"class","grants":{},"prerequisite":"","requiresBloodied":false,"schemaVersion":{"version":0.019,"lastMigration":{"version":{"schema":0.018,"foundry":"11.315","system":"0.18.11"}}},"classes":""},"effects":[],"flags":{},"folder":null,"_id":"tyr1c66fm2tdceko"}

Performing a battle dirge requires your concentration, as though you were casting a spell, and is sustained as long as you maintain concentration on it. You may select a target for your battle dirge at any time (no reaction is required), at which point the battle dirge takes place immediately and your use of the battle dirge is expended.

A creature may not be under the effects of more than one battle dirge from the same dirgesinger at a time.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">For battle dirges with effects that only go away at the end of a long rest or a short rest (and that include other long-term costs, such as death saves or fatigue), the creature may be targeted by other battle dirges, but it may not be targeted by the same battle dirge until it has recovered from the effects of the first dirge.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Table: Battle Dirges</em></p><div dir=\"ltr\" align=\"left\"><table><colgroup><col width=\"90\"><col width=\"533\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td><p dir=\"ltr\">Dirgesinger Level</p></td><td><p dir=\"ltr\">Battle Dirge</p></td></tr><tr><td><p dir=\"ltr\">1st&ndash;4th</p></td><td><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Mind-Rattling Spell</strong>: You cause the target creature&rsquo;s spell to surge with mind-rattling power. When the target creature casts a spell that deals damage, you may cause it to reroll all 1s and 2s on the damage dice, adding to the total damage rather than replacing the initial rolls. Alternatively, when the target creature casts a spell that doesn&rsquo;t deal damage and requires a save, you cause its save DC to be increased by an amount equal to half your proficiency bonus (rounded down). For the next minute, the target is unable to concentrate or cast that same spell again.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Frantic Dash</strong>: You cause the target creature&rsquo;s movement, jump height, and jump distance to be tripled for one turn and you cause attacks of opportunity against the creature to be at disadvantage. The creature&rsquo;s movement speed then becomes 0 for two turns and the creature loses 2 hit dice.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Final Defense</strong>: You cause a target creature to take no damage from an attack, but it takes a level of Strife and Fatigue instead.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Strained Aim</strong>: You cause a target creature to triple the range of its ranged weapon attack. The creature also has advantage to hit and does not receive disadvantage for long-range shots. Then, for the next minute, all of the creature&rsquo;s attacks with ranged weapons are reduced to one-third their usual distance and only add half of the creature&rsquo;s proficiency bonus to hit.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Breath of Death</strong>: You cause a creature that was reduced to 0 hit points to roll a number of hit dice equal to its proficiency bonus (without losing or expending them), gain the total as hit points, and remain standing. If the creature has a reaction, it may move up to half its movement speed without provoking attacks of opportunity as a reaction. The creature then has its death saves set to 2 failures until the end of its next long rest and becomes Doomed if it is reduced to 0 hit points before then.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Fallible Beauty</strong>: You cause a creature to have advantage on all Culture, Deception, Intimidation, and Persuasion checks for the next minute. The creature then is treated as if it were Charmed by all other creatures for the next 10 minutes.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p dir=\"ltr\">5th&ndash;8th</p></td><td><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Desperate Strike</strong>: You cause the target creature&rsquo;s weapon attack, natural weapon attack, or unarmed strike to become a critical hit. For the next minute after, all creatures gain an expertise die on attacks that aren&rsquo;t spells against the target creature.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Forgetful Genius</strong>: You cause a target creature to double its proficiency bonus, expertise die roll, and skill speciality roll on one skill check. The creature then loses proficiency, all expertise die, and all skill specialties on that skill the end of its next short rest.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Healing Overclock</strong>: You cause a creature casting a spell or using an ability or feature that heals to heal itself (or others) for twice the normal amount. Then, the next three spells (or abilities) that the creature uses to heal itself (or others) heal only the minimum amount possible.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Spells of a lower spell level than the boosted spell, or abilities and features gained at a lower level than the boosted ability or feature, only add half a point toward the three needed to recover from this dirge.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Spell Burnout</strong>: You cause a creature casting a spell to cast it at the highest spell level available to the creature&rsquo;s class or archetype (even if the creature doesn&rsquo;t have access to spells of that level yet). The creature then loses hit dice equal to the level the spell was cast at, becomes vulnerable to damage from spells, and is unable to cast cantrips or spells as rituals until the end of its next long rest.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Utterly Maddened Attacker</strong>: You cause a creature to gain advantage on all its attacks and have its critical hit range with all attacks increase by 1 for the next minute. However, the creature must use every type of action available to it to attack creatures within its reach or range; if there are no creatures within its reach or range to attack, it must move toward the nearest creature to it and begin attacking.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Whenever the target creature misses with an attack, it takes damage equal to its proficiency bonus.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p dir=\"ltr\">9th&ndash;12th</p></td><td><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Frantic Activity</strong>: For a number of turns equal to half your proficiency bonus, you cause the target creature to take two bonus actions on its turn, each of which may be a single attack with a weapon, unarmed strike, natural weapon, cantrip, or other ability already usable with a bonus action. Then, for a number of turns equal to your proficiency bonus, the target creature may only take an action or bonus action, not both, on its turns and may not make more than one attack as an action or bonus action.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Blinding Stillness</strong>: You cause a creature to gain truesight for as far as it can see for the next minute. The creature only benefits from this truesight while willingly moving. At all other times it is Blinded in all of its senses, even senses that do not require sight. For example, while using a move action or a Cunning Action to move, the creature would have truesight. While using an action or reaction to attack or cast a spell, even if while splitting up a move action, the creature would be Blinded unless the creature is explicitly using an attack, maneuver, or spell that includes willing movement.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p dir=\"ltr\">13th&ndash;16th</p></td><td><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Rested Burnout</strong>: You cause a creature to gain the benefits of a short rest instantly. The creature may not benefit from short rests and recovers only the minimum amount from all healing effects until the end of its next long rest.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Bleeding Aim</strong>: You cause a creature that missed a weapon or spell attack to reroll, neither benefitting from advantage or hurting from disadvantage with this new roll. If the creature misses the attack with this second roll, it loses 2 hit dice.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Strained Resistance</strong>: You cause a creature that failed a save to succeed instead, but gain a level of Fatigue and Strife.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p dir=\"ltr\">17th&ndash;20th</p></td><td><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Reactive Overburn</strong>: You cause a creature, for one round, to be able to take any number of reactions. The creature takes 2 damage when it takes its second reaction, which is doubled when it takes its third, doubled again for its fourth, and so on. When the creature has an opportunity to take a reaction, it is magically forced to, even if doing so would reduce it to 0 hit points.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Stone of Stumbling</strong>: You cause a creature to add an expertise die to its Armor Class against every attack for the next minute. During this time all of the creature&rsquo;s movement speeds are reduced to 0 and the creature may not willingly move. The target creature gains the ability to Trip as a reaction when another creature enters or tries to leave its threatened area, but it must use its reaction to trip the first creature that triggers this effect.</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>&nbsp;</p>","favorite":false,"secretDescription":"","source":"motifClasses","uses":{"value":0,"max":"","per":"","recharge":{"formula":"1d6","threshold":6}},"concentration":false,"featureType":"class","grants":{},"prerequisite":"","requiresBloodied":false,"schemaVersion":{"version":0.019,"lastMigration":{"version":{"schema":0.018,"foundry":"11.315","system":"0.18.11"}}},"classes":""},"effects":[],"flags":{},"folder":null,"_id":"aw3shf33a5piftdd"}

A creature that succeeds on this saving throw is immune to the charming effect of your scales for 24 hours.</p></li><li><p><strong>Viscous Humors</strong>: You gain immunity to ongoing damage and creatures that hit you with a melee weapon attack must make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC or have their weapon become stuck to you, requiring an action to free it.</p></li><li><p><strong>Divine Essence</strong>: Your Eldritch Blast deals your choice of radiant, necrotic, or psychic damage and the damage die increases by one step. The first time each round that you successfully deal damage with Eldritch Blast, a creature other than you that you can see within 30 feet is healed for 2d8 hit points.</p></li><li><p><strong>Scuttling Passage</strong>: Your walking speed doubles and you gain a climb speed equal to your walking speed. The sound of your passage is unnerving, requiring creatures within 30 feet that can hear you to make a Wisdom save against your spell save DC or become frightened of you until the end of their next turn. A creature that successfully saves becomes immune to the frightening effect of Scuttling Passage for 24 hours.</p></li><li><p><strong>Eyes of Doom</strong>: You gain <em>Truesight</em> with a range of 30 feet. In addition, any creature within this range that does not avert its eyes (making attacks against you at disadvantage) meets your gaze and must make a Charisma saving throw or gain a level of strife.</p></li><li><p><strong>Voice of the Messenger</strong>: You cannot be silenced and your voice booms to a range of 300 feet. Whenever you speak or cast a spell with vocalized spell components, creatures within 30 feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or be deafened for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, regaining its hearing and becoming immune to the deafening effect for 24 hours on a success.</p></li></ul><p>You may choose different traits each time you use this ability.

See Chapter 11: Spellcasting in the Adventurer’s Guide for the general rules of spellcasting and the Spells Listing for the Artificer spell list.</p><h3><strong>Spell Inventions</strong></h3><p>Whenever you prepare an artificer spell, you create a spell invention for that spell using your tools of artifice and whatever materials you have on hand.</p><p>A spell invention is a unique experimental device that is esoteric and useless to other creatures, but in your hands can be used to cast the spell it was prepared for. You prepare a number of spells with a spell level no higher than your maximum spell level (both as shown on the Artificer table) chosen from the artificer spell list.</p><p>You can change your list of prepared spells and replace or create new spell inventions whenever you finish a long rest by spending at least 10 minutes tinkering and experimenting with 1 gold worth of materials per new spell invention (in addition to any material components the spell requires). Any spell inventions you’ve prepared previously are taken apart and integrated into the new ones, or fall apart due to a lack of maintenance. You can only have a maximum of 1 spell invention per spell you have prepared.</p><p>You do not have spell slots, and instead utilize your spell inventions to cast spells. Whenever you cast a prepared artificer spell using a spell invention, you may cast it at a spell slot level up to your maximum spell level as shown on the Artificer table. You may freely draw a spell invention from your inventory as part of the same action used to cast a spell through it, and you may also freely stow any spell inventions you were already wielding using that same action.</p><p>Using a spell invention does not remove its spell from your list of prepared spells.</p><p>You can determine the exact form a spell invention takes but it weighs 1 pound per spell level, is no longer than 1 foot in any dimension, and it must be wielded in at least one hand to be used (treat cantrips as 1st-level spells). A spell invention has an AC equal to 10 + your Intelligence modifier, and a number of hit points equal to your artificer level × 2. You can fully repair your spell inventions whenever you finish a long rest, so long as you have access to your tools of artifice.</p><p><strong><em>Fizzle Die</em></strong>. After you cast a spell using a spell invention, you must roll a fizzle die, a 1d4. If the result is less than or equal to the spell slot level used to cast the spell, your spell invention burns out, runs out of power, or otherwise malfunctions and cannot be used again until repaired. Your fizzle die improves by one step at 10th level (from 1d4 to 1d6) and again at 20th level (from 1d6 to 1d8), and it improves by one step when using a spell invention gained from your artificer archetype (maximum 1d10).</p><h3><strong>Cantrips</strong></h3><p>At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the artificer spell list and construct a spell invention for each. Unlike your other spell inventions, using these does not require rolling a fizzle die. You learn additional artificer cantrips of your choice at higher levels and construct<br>spell inventions for them, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Artificer table. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the artificer cantrips you know with another cantrip from the artificer spell list.</p><h3><strong>Spellcasting Ability</strong></h3><p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your artificer spells. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an artificer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one, and for setting the saving throw DC of an artificer feature.</p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p><h3><strong>Scientific Ritual Casting</strong></h3><p>You can cast an artificer spell as a ritual using a spell invention if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared. When using a spell invention in this way, you do not have to roll the fizzle die.</p><h3><strong>Tools of Artifice</strong></h3><p>You produce your spell inventions and infuse items using your tools which act as your spellcasting focus. These tools can be a @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-adventuring-gear.gqei4i287bd3smhh]{Sewing Kit}, @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-adventuring-gear.t08r0mi814lydsa3]{Smith's Tools}, @UUID[Compendium.a5e.a5e-adventuring-gear.3k3o90tq7gclpuem]{Thieves' Tools}, or any sort of artisan’s tools. After you gain the ability to infuse items at 2nd level, you can also use any item bearing one of your infusions as tools of artifice. You must be proficient with the tools you use in this way.</p>","favorite":false,"secretDescription":"","source":"gpg0","uses":{"value":0,"max":"","per":"","recharge":{"formula":"1d6","threshold":6}},"concentration":false,"featureType":"class","grants":{},"prerequisite":"","requiresBloodied":false,"schemaVersion":{"version":0.019,"lastMigration":{"version":{"schema":0.018,"foundry":"11.315","system":"0.18.11"}}},"classes":""},"effects":[],"flags":{},"folder":null,"_id":"303s4yjiebebbvtu"}

The creature is friendly to you and your allies and acts on each of your turns. You decide what action it takes and how it moves. The Narrator has the creature's statistics and resolves all of its actions and movement.</p><p>If the spell becomes permanent, you no longer control the creature. It might remain friendly to you, depending on how you have treated it.</p><p>Creature into Object: You turn the target and whatever it is wearing and carrying into an object.

When making checks for your custom vehicle, treat it as a land vehicle while it is grounded and an air vehicle while it is airborne.</p><h3>Buzzsaws</h3><p>Your custom vehicle gains inbuilt defenses in the form of motorized saws. While driving your custom vehicle you can make an attack using the saws as an action at any time during the vehicle&rsquo;s movement.

Creatures can attempt to escape this grapple as normal, using your passive Engineering score instead of your maneuver DC. Your custom vehicle&rsquo;s movement is not impeded by grappling a creature, and your vehicle may grapple a maximum of 1 creature at a time.</p><p>In addition, while driving your custom vehicle you may use the mechanical claws to lift or manipulate objects. The mechanical claws use your Intelligence to determine their carrying capacity, and when using them to make an Athletics check you may make an Engineering check instead.</p><h3>Submersible</h3><p>Your custom vehicle becomes a water vehicle (with a swim speed of 40 feet or 4 miles per hour, or an existing swim speed increased by 20 feet or 2 miles per hour) in addition to being a land vehicle. When making checks for this vehicle, treat it as a water vehicle while it travels over water and as a land vehicle when it travels overland. In addition, your custom vehicle gains the three-dimensional vehicle property when traveling in water.
