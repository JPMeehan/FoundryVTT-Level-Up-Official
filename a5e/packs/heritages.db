These planetouched often have a color scheme that is brighter than those of other heritages, with lots of golds and warm hues being found among them. Their divine blood also twists their features into something frighteningly angelic, resulting in horns that resemble halos or headdresses, and occasionally even planetouched with extra sets of eyes.

Tieflings can be spotted by the horns growing from their skulls and they often have skin colored like their fiendish ancestors, some also smelling faintly of sulfur or brimstone. You have the following traits:</p><p><em><strong>Hellish Resistance.</strong></em> You have resistance to fire damage.</p><p><em><strong>Infernal Legacy.</strong></em> You know the <em>produce flame</em> cantrip.

Those whose ancestors are from barren deserts have adapted in different ways from those who historically dwelled in the forests or plains. Additionally, those few tribes that revel in battle have grown to have different traits than those that value family or their ancestors above all else. In addition to the traits granted by your orcish heritage, choose one of the following heritage gifts.</p><h3>Acclimatized</h3><p>Your family hails from an area known for its extreme conditions, such as the arctic, desert, or even a particularly treacherous swamp. Even if you have not spent much time there, the ability of your family to adapt to their living conditions has been passed down to you. Orcs with this gift can vary wildly in appearance due to the area which they are from; those from the desert may have taken on a paler, dusky skin tone in order to survive the heat, while those from the arctic may have a coating of fine hairs and darker skin tones in order to retain heat.</p><p><em><strong>Just Like Home.</strong></em> Choose one type of terrain, reflecting the area from which your family hails: arctic, desert, mountain, or swamp. You ignore all naturally created difficult terrain of that type. Additionally, you gain an expertise die on Survival checks made within this terrain type, and gain a type of damage resistance related to your chosen terrain: arctic &mdash; cold, desert &mdash; fire, mountain &mdash; lightning, swamp &mdash; poison.</p><h3>Ancestral Blessing</h3><p>Orcs with this gift are believed to have been blessed by their ancestors. Every family has their own beliefs for why this occurs; it could be to honor the good deeds of their parents, the success of their clan in battle or the arts, or even to take pity on a child in a desperate situation. Orcs with this heritage often seem to have a sort of divine aura that sets them apart. You have the following traits:</p><p><em><strong>Divine Protection.</strong></em> You have resistance to radiant damage.</p><p><em><strong>Touch of Divinity.</strong></em> You know the <em>resistance </em>cantrip. In addition, you can cast the <em>shield</em> spell once per long rest.</p><h3>Magic Adept</h3><p>The true origin of the magic adepts &mdash; the odanti &mdash; has been lost to time, but the elders tell tales of fey-touched ancestors and the tribe&rsquo;s proclivity for magic.</p><p>You are born with magic coursing through your veins, and are able to utilize it in a number of ways. You learn one cantrip of your choice from the wizard spell list. At 3rd level, choose one 1st- or 2nd-level spell from the wizard spell list. You can cast the chosen spell without any material components once per long rest. A 1st-level spell chosen this way can be cast at 2nd-level using this trait, if the spell allows. Your spellcasting ability for this trait is the same as the ability score used in the spellcasting class in which you have the highest level, or Charisma if you have no levels in a spellcasting class.</p><h2>Orc Paragon</h2><p>Starting at 10th level, you become a paragon of orcishness. You gain the following feature.</p><h3>Relentless Resilience</h3><p>When you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can drop to 1 hit point instead. Once you have used this trait, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.</p><p>Additionally, the many struggles of your ancestors has given you a thick skin, and the ability to shrug off less powerful blows. Your Armor Class increases by 1.</p><h2>Suggested Cultures</h2><p>While you can choose any culture for your orc character, the following cultures are linked closely with this heritage: caravanner, stoic orc, wildling.</p>","grants":{"XPMnpdyRjcCCFPdE":{"grantType":"movement","level":0,"optional":false,"label":"Speed","bonus":"30","movementTypes":{"base":["walk"],"options":[],"total":0},"_id":"XPMnpdyRjcCCFPdE","default":true,"img":"","unit":"feet","context":{"isHover":false}},"4FxMZZGqnWxlYKFz":{"grantType":"feature","level":0,"optional":false,"label":"Traits","features":{"base":[{"uuid":"Compendium.a5e.a5e-heritage-features.Item.henjoxiitpm6hfdt","limitedReselection":true,"selectionLimit":1},{"uuid":"Compendium.a5e.a5e-heritage-features.Item.yca3krmolgs6ne6s","limitedReselection":true,"selectionLimit":1},{"uuid":"Compendium.a5e.a5e-heritage-features.Item.71rrfuwva6r4bt7y","limitedReselection":true,"selectionLimit":1}],"options":[],"total":0},"_id":"4FxMZZGqnWxlYKFz","default":true,"img":""},"sakfZmzqu5Vx4p26":{"grantType":"feature","level":0,"optional":false,"label":"Gifts","features":{"total":1,"options":[{"uuid":"Compendium.a5e.a5e-heritage-features.Item.rm4j7t05gfjepdl3","limitedReselection":true,"selectionLimit":1},{"uuid":"Compendium.a5e.a5e-heritage-features.Item.izfbyta7ufd7fdum","limitedReselection":true,"selectionLimit":1},{"uuid":"Compendium.a5e.a5e-heritage-features.Item.iatzw3ejunigb3v4","limitedReselection":true,"selectionLimit":1}],"base":[]},"_id":"sakfZmzqu5Vx4p26","default":true,"img":""},"9aewZXEAHF3fZbL4":{"grantType":"feature","level":10,"optional":true,"label":"Paragon Gifts","features":{"base":[{"uuid":"Compendium.a5e.a5e-paragon-gifts.Item.jupfvy87i6hrfnzs","limitedReselection":true,"selectionLimit":1}],"options":[],"total":0}}},"source":"adventurersGuide"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"flags":{},"_id":"7gtmc6d0m33032ln"}

You gain profi- ciency in one additional skill of your choice.</p><p>In addition, you require half as much time as normal to train yourself in the use of a suit of armor, tool, or weapon during downtime.</p><p><em><strong>Intrepid.</strong></em> Your survival instinct is remarkably strong. When you make an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, you can choose to gain an expertise die on that roll. Once you use this trait, you cannot use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h2>Human Gifts</h2><p>Humanity&rsquo;s most overlooked trait is their physical and spiritual endurance. How a human exhibits this hereditary resilience varies on their personal disposition. In addition to the traits found in your human heritage, select one of the following gifts.</p><h3>Diehard Survivor</h3><p>Foes of humanity may see them as ants, but humans are equally difficult to eliminate. The ancestors of human beings learned to survive through the harshest conditions, including drought, winter, and famine. Humans, in their stubbornness, can even pull them- selves back from the brink of death to fulfill their dreams. You have the following traits:</p><p><em><strong>Feast and Famine.</strong></em> You can tighten your belt during hard times. You can go a number of days equal to your Constitution modifier without suffering any fatigue from lack of Supply. After- wards you require twice as much Supply for as many days as you went without.</p><p><em><strong>Radical Perseverance.</strong></em> Through your sheer stub- bornness and will to live, you sometimes manage to wriggle out of death&rsquo;s grasp. You only die after failing 4 death saving throws instead of 3.</p><h3>Ingenious Focus</h3><p>Not all human minds work the same &mdash; some have a nearly miraculous level of focus. People with this intellectual mode often bring a surprising level of insight and passion to almost any topic they engage. In spite of their brilliance, they typically have difficulty with more general awareness. You have the following traits:</p><p><em><strong>Inexorable Concentration.</strong></em> When you fail a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentra- tion, you can immediately reroll it, taking the new result. You may use this trait a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum 1), and regain all expended uses after a long rest.</p><p><em><strong>Resident Expert.</strong></em> You have a reputation for painstaking detail on certain tasks and subjects. Choose two tools with which you are proficient, or a skill with which you are proficient from Animal Handling, Arcana, Culture, Engineering, History, Medicine, Nature, or Religion. When you make a check with that tool or skill and the d20 shows a natural result of less than 10, you can count the d20 result as being 10.</p><h3>Spirited Traveler</h3><p>The power of movement is one of humanity&rsquo;s evolutionary advantages. An ancient human hunting strategy for killing fast game is persistence hunting &mdash; following prey relentlessly, shifting between walking and running endlessly until a beast became too exhausted to defend itself. Many humans maintain their health through running, and foot races are a universal favorite game. In a word, humans gifted at running will go far. You have the following traits:</p><p><em><strong>Desperate Dash. </strong></em>When you take the Dash action, your movement this turn does not provoke opportunity attacks. During this movement, you gain an expertise die on Acrobatics checks made to avoid hazards and Dexterity saving throws. Once you use this trait, you cannot use it again until you finish a short rest.</p><p><em><strong>Marathon Runner.</strong></em> The first time between each long rest you would gain a level of fatigue, you do not gain that level of fatigue. You still suffer a level of fatigue from finishing a long rest without any Supply.</p><p><em><strong>Sojourner&rsquo;s Fortitude.</strong></em> You gain an expertise die on saving throws made to resist fatigue for marching longer than 8 hours.</p><h2>Human Paragon</h2><p>When you reach 10th level, you are an exemplar of humankind, and you gain one paragon gift from the following list.</p><h3>Determined</h3><p>When you are bloodied and make an attack roll or saving throw, you can use this feature to treat the result of the d20 roll as a natural 20. Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h3>Wind at Your Back</h3><p>Your Speed increases by 10 feet. You ignore difficult terrain when you Dash. When you make a melee weapon attack against a creature, until the end of your turn you do not provoke opportunity attacks from it.</p><h3>Voracious Learner</h3><p>You gain an expertise die in each of three different skill or tool proficiencies.</p><h2>Suggested Cultures</h2><p>While you can choose any culture for your human character, the following cultures are linked closely with this heritage: cosmopolitan, imperial, settler, villager.</p>","grants":{"9Pl88ZdkiiNYgN9S":{"grantType":"movement","level":0,"optional":false,"label":"Speed","bonus":"30","movementTypes":{"base":["walk"],"options":[],"total":0},"_id":"9Pl88ZdkiiNYgN9S","default":true,"img":"","unit":"feet","context":{"isHover":false}},"oRwtQy5YM5tjDYib":{"grantType":"feature","level":0,"optional":false,"label":"Traits","features":{"base":[{"uuid":"Compendium.a5e.a5e-heritage-features.Item.t4arw241exmcmcif","limitedReselection":true,"selectionLimit":1},{"uuid":"Compendium.a5e.a5e-heritage-features.Item.cr5kqil4cxr6ll9k","limitedReselection":true,"selectionLimit":1}],"options":[],"total":0},"_id":"oRwtQy5YM5tjDYib","default":true,"img":""},"kFAi9MDHoNgLk7Tw":{"grantType":"feature","level":0,"optional":false,"label":"Gifts","features":{"base":[],"options":[{"uuid":"Compendium.a5e.a5e-heritage-features.Item.e6w4vlq0o7c677si","limitedReselection":true,"selectionLimit":1},{"uuid":"Compendium.a5e.a5e-heritage-features.Item.u87je2s19dqwr57s","limitedReselection":true,"selectionLimit":1},{"uuid":"Compendium.a5e.a5e-heritage-features.Item.6hq6v2ie4ea6zzdp","limitedReselection":true,"selectionLimit":1}],"total":1},"_id":"kFAi9MDHoNgLk7Tw","default":true,"img":""},"AcPJfvyn50r8q585":{"grantType":"feature","level":10,"optional":true,"label":"Paragon Gifts","features":{"options":[{"uuid":"Compendium.a5e.a5e-paragon-gifts.Item.70hbk6xnfreicep9","limitedReselection":true,"selectionLimit":1},{"uuid":"Compendium.a5e.a5e-paragon-gifts.Item.t9v8wys76pbvy99s","limitedReselection":true,"selectionLimit":1},{"uuid":"Compendium.a5e.a5e-paragon-gifts.Item.zgtuu1oy48290xzu","limitedReselection":true,"selectionLimit":1}],"total":1,"base":[]}}},"source":"adventurersGuide"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"flags":{},"_id":"o5yudp3jm2nqf5qf"}

There are a few prominent trends in halflings though. In addition to the traits found in your halfling heritage, select one of the following halfling gifts.</p><h3>Burrowing Claws</h3><p>If their creation myth is to be believed, halflings have a primordial form still represented by a trait sometimes seen today. You are significantly more hirsute than most halflings, and prone to patches of scruffy hair along your forearms and back. Your irises are often quite wide and deeply black, and your rocklike fingernails tend to grow with flattened edges. In halfling communities, these traits often come with insulting nicknames like &ldquo;shovel-claws&rdquo; or &ldquo;scruffs&rdquo;. You have the following traits:</p><p><em><strong>Burrow.</strong></em> You have a burrowing speed of 10 feet. You can use your burrowing speed to move through nonmagical sand, loose earth, loamy soil, mud, or snow, but not solid rock. You do not naturally leave any sort of tunnel behind but you can attempt to create a 5-foot by 5-foot wide tunnel in earth, soil, or snow by spending extra time and effort shoring it up and adding support. This reduces your burrowing speed to 5 feet every 15 minutes.</p><p><em><strong>Claws.</strong></em> Your nails grow into strong shovel-like claws. The claws are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes that deal slashing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier.</p><h3>Tuft Feet</h3><p>You have thick patches of bushy hair that grow atop your proportionally large feet. You don&rsquo;t need to wear shoes, or any sort of foot covering, as your big hairy feet are usually calloused and tough enough to tread on most anything. You have the following traits:</p><p><em><strong>Big Feet.</strong></em> You gain an expertise die on checks and saving throws made to resist being knocked prone.</p><p><em><strong>Thick Soles.</strong></em> You are immune to damage from sharp terrain hazards (such as caltrops, broken glass, or the spike growth spell) and ignore difficult terrain caused by them. Additionally, other kinds of difficult terrain reduces your movement speed by 5 feet instead of halving it.</p><h3>Twilight-Touched</h3><p>You are blanched of both emotion and color with wide, alarmingly pure white eyes, and skin that is either starkly pallid or disquietingly sallow. There&rsquo;s no hair at all atop your head or you have only a few bedraggled locks of hair. You form stronger communal bonds than other halflings, and can speak without the need for words.

Elves today can live to be 700 or older, and legends speak of elves who simply never die.</p><p><em><strong>Size.</strong></em> Elves have a slender and graceful build. Some stand as tall as average humans, although most are a head or so shorter. Your size is Medium.</p><p><em><strong>Speed.</strong></em> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p><p><em><strong>Darkvision.</strong></em> Having your ancestral origins in the twilight realms, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can&rsquo;t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p><p><em><strong>Fey Ancestry.</strong></em> You gain an expertise die on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can&rsquo;t put you to sleep.</p><p><em><strong>Trance.</strong></em> Elves don&rsquo;t need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining conscious (the Common word for such meditation is &ldquo;trance.&rdquo;) While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that became reflexive through years of practice. When you take a long rest, you spend 4 hours in your trance state (instead of sleeping for 6 hours). During the trance you suffer no penalty to passive Perception. A long rest remains 8 hours for you as normal, and the remainder of the time must be filled only with light activity.</p><h2>Elf Gifts</h2><p>Elves are known for their uncanny perceptiveness, which according to some can even extend to the power to read minds and see the future &mdash; although such powers are very rare. In addition to the traits found in your elf heritage, select one of the following gifts.</p><h3>Mystic Rapport</h3><p>Some elves are so attuned to the arcane that they can see magical energy with their eyes, sense the presence of nearby elves, and communicate mentally.</p><p>Elves with the gift of Mystic Rapport have the following traits:</p><p><em><strong>Arcane Sensitivity.</strong></em> You gain proficiency in Arcana.</p><p><em><strong>Arcane Empathy.</strong></em> Your sensitivity to the flow of magic lets you speak to the hearts of others. You have a limited ability to communicate telepath- ically with those within 30 feet of you. Though this grants the target no ability to respond telepathically, they can understand you as long as you share a language with them.</p><h3>Prescient Vision</h3><p>Some elves don&rsquo;t live in the present moment, their spirits shifting back and forth in the currents of time. Although mainly used for contemplation, this mystical experience is also useful for predicting what may yet come to pass &mdash; though like sand in the waves, the future is always churning.</p><p>Elves with the gift of Prescient Vision have the following trait:</p><p><em><strong>Glance the Future. </strong></em>Your eyes can see a few moments into the future, and your mind appre- hends the divergent possibilities. Once between rests you can use a bonus action to roll a d20 and record the result. Before the end of your next short or long rest, when a creature you can see within 60 feet makes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, you can use your reaction to replace their roll with your recorded result. When the creature is also rolling an expertise die, only the d20 roll is replaced. When the creature is rolling more than one d20, such as when it has advan- tage or when a halfling is using their Lucky trait, the replacement applies to the creature&rsquo;s final roll. Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h3>Preternatural Awareness</h3><p>The conventional senses of elves are thought to be more finely tuned than those of other mortals. Some scholars debate whether it is merely a matter of sensitivity, or if the elvish trance meditation heightens their awareness in a way other mortals simply are unable to rival.</p><p>Elves with the gift of Preternatural Awareness have the following traits:</p><p><em><strong>Keen Senses.</strong></em> You gain proficiency in Perception.</p><p><em><strong>Prophetic Instincts.</strong></em> Your ability to detect danger is nearly supernatural. You gain a bonus to initiative rolls equal to your Wisdom modifier, and you can&rsquo;t be surprised while conscious (including during your Trance).</p><h2>Elven Paragon</h2><p>When you reach 10th level, you are an exemplar of elfkind, and you gain one paragon gift from the following list.</p><h3>Elfsight</h3><p>Nature cannot block the legendary accuracy of your people. Your attack rolls ignore half cover, and an area being lightly obscured does not impose disadvantage on your ability checks. You do not have disadvantage from making ranged attacks at long range.</p><h3>Inexorable Darkvision</h3><p>There is no range limit for your darkvision.</p><h3>Spiritual Awareness</h3><p>You are able to cast detect thoughts a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus between each long rest. Your spellcasting ability for this spell is Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma (whichever is highest).</p><h2>Suggested Cultures</h2><p>While you can choose any culture for your elf char- acter, the following cultures are linked closely with this heritage: eladrin, high elf, shadow elf, wood elf.</p>","grants":{"FEQj3C7k0Wa8fm0q":{"grantType":"movement","level":0,"optional":false,"label":"Speed","context":{"valueIfOriginalIsZero":"30","isHover":false},"movementTypes":{"base":["walk"],"options":[],"total":0},"_id":"FEQj3C7k0Wa8fm0q","default":true,"img":"","bonus":"30","unit":"feet"},"JVxfDAU3Zj9fZTg9":{"grantType":"feature","level":0,"optional":false,"label":"Traits","features":{"base":[{"uuid":"Compendium.a5e.a5e-heritage-features.Item.vxg3dvf4emn7lyq3","limitedReselection":true,"selectionLimit":1},{"uuid":"Compendium.a5e.a5e-heritage-features.Item.6p5blmxyd9d628r0","limitedReselection":true,"selectionLimit":1},{"uuid":"Compendium.a5e.a5e-heritage-features.Item.71rrfuwva6r4bt7y","limitedReselection":true,"selectionLimit":1}],"options":[],"total":0},"_id":"JVxfDAU3Zj9fZTg9","default":true,"img":""},"lypaBkIYqOQh3AVP":{"grantType":"feature","level":0,"optional":false,"label":"Gifts","features":{"options":[{"uuid":"Compendium.a5e.a5e-heritage-features.Item.i4qcwlz96esb75ic","limitedReselection":true,"selectionLimit":1},{"uuid":"Compendium.a5e.a5e-heritage-features.Item.ooh3jxxytxlvcj9z","limitedReselection":true,"selectionLimit":1},{"uuid":"Compendium.a5e.a5e-heritage-features.Item.8i87g72qjelnzg3n","limitedReselection":true,"selectionLimit":1}],"total":1,"base":[]},"_id":"lypaBkIYqOQh3AVP","default":true,"img":""},"hEzIDtZ5P4x2cCWv":{"grantType":"feature","level":10,"optional":true,"label":"Paragon Gifts","features":{"options":[{"uuid":"Compendium.a5e.a5e-paragon-gifts.Item.cim3npgayypsgn5d","limitedReselection":true,"selectionLimit":1},{"uuid":"Compendium.a5e.a5e-paragon-gifts.Item.hcf2fnn0t6m7gyrf","limitedReselection":true,"selectionLimit":1},{"uuid":"Compendium.a5e.a5e-paragon-gifts.Item.1t0gsvn2yj6726sm","limitedReselection":true,"selectionLimit":1}],"total":1,"base":[]}}},"source":"adventurersGuide"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"flags":{},"_id":"rt2hd5nncmnxu1v4"}

They develop quickly, reaching the equivalent development of an adolescent human by the age of 3, and then fully maturing into adults by the age of 15. Their maximum life span is about 80 years.</p><p><em><strong>Size.</strong></em> Dragonborn have imposing statures. Most stand well over 6 feet tall and weigh between 250 and 300 pounds. Your size is Medium.</p><p><em><strong>Speed.</strong></em> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p><p><em><strong>Dragon Breath.</strong></em> Drawing upon great reservoirs of draconic power, you can unleash magical destruction upon your foes. You can use your dragon breath as an action.</p><p>Choose the type of damage dealt by your breath weapon from the following list: acid, cold, fire, force, lightning, necrotic, poison, psychic, radiant, or thunder.</p><p>Additionally, choose between a 30-foot line that is 5 feet wide or a 15-foot cone for the area that your breath weapon affects. Each creature in the breath&rsquo;s area makes a Dexterity saving throw. If your breath weapon deals psychic damage, a Wisdom saving throw is made instead of Dexterity; if cold, necrotic, poison, radiant, or thunder, a Constitution saving throw. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus.</p><p>A creature takes 2d6 damage on a failed saving throw, or half damage on a success. The damage increases to 3d6 at 4th level, 4d6 at 9th level, 5d6 at 14th level, and 6d6 at 19th level.</p><p>After you use your dragon breath, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h2>Dragonborn Gifts</h2><p>Dragonborn are diverse and highly varied even within a single draconic progenitor&rsquo;s bloodline. In addition to the traits found in your dragonborn heritage, select one of the following dragonborn gifts.</p><h3>Draconic Armor</h3><p>Some dragonborn grow tougher scales and sharper claws. These dragonborn tend to have short tails, wide faces, and broad shoulders, all of which are usually ridged with hardened scales or tipped with spikes. You have the following traits:</p><p><em><strong>Claws.</strong></em> You grow retractable claws from the tips of your fingers. Extending or retracting the claws requires no action. The claws are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes that deal slashing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier.</p><p><em><strong>Resistance.</strong></em> You have resistance to the damage type dealt by your Dragon Breath.</p><p><em><strong>Scales.</strong></em> You have tough interlocked draconic scales. While you aren&rsquo;t wearing armor, your AC equals 13 + your Dexterity modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.</p><h3>Draconic Fins</h3><p>Some dragonborn seem naturally adapted to aquatic environments with sleek, hydrodynamic, and often reflective scales. These dragonborn tend to have webbed hands and feet, and long serpentine tails. They also tend to grow soft fin-like scales along their legs and forearms. You have the following traits:</p><p><em><strong>Swimmer.</strong></em> You have a swimming speed of 30 feet and you can hold your breath for up to 15 minutes at a time.</p><p><em><strong>Deep Darkvision. </strong></em>You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can&rsquo;t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. In addition, your eyes are perfectly adapted for spotting movement at depth, and the radius of your darkvision increases to 120 feet while underwater.</p><p><em><strong>Hard to Hit.</strong></em> You either have a tough shell or your quick movements and reflective scales make you difficult to strike. While you aren&rsquo;t wearing armor, your AC equals 12 + your Dexterity modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.</p><h3>Draconic Wings</h3><p>Some dragonborn are born with draconic wings. They tend to have slender frames and smooth scale patterns, along with a&nbsp;long rudder-like tail to help them fly with their stocky wings. They&rsquo;re far too heavy and lack the strength to really soar like&nbsp;true dragons, but their wings still allow them to lift off and fly a considerable&nbsp;distance before tiring.</p><p><em><strong>Flight.</strong></em> You have a fly speed of 30 feet. To use this speed, you can&rsquo;t be wearing medium or heavy armor. Whenever you spend 3 full consec- utive rounds airborne without landing, you gain a level of fatigue. Any fatigue gained in this way is removed upon finishing a short or long rest.</p><h2>Draconic Paragon</h2><p>With enough time and training any dragonborn can unlock their draconic potential. When you reach 10th level, your dragonborn gift dramatically improves.</p><p>In addition, you gain resistance to the damage type dealt by your Dragon Breath. If you already have resistance to that type of damage, you gain immunity to it instead.</p><h3>Impenetrable Draconic Armor</h3><p>Your claws and scales harden to the deadly consis- tency of a true dragon. Your claws deal slashing damage equal to 1d8 + your Strength modifier, and your AC increases by 1.</p><h3>Mighty Draconic Wings</h3><p>Your fly speed increases to 40 feet and you can fly while wearing medium or heavy armor. When you would suffer fatigue from using your fly speed, you make a Constitution saving throw (DC 10 + 1 per previous save in the last minute). On a success, you do not suffer fatigue from flying that round.</p><h3>Sleek Draconic Fins</h3><p>Your swim speed increases to 45 feet, you can breathe underwater, and your darkvision increases to 120 feet (or 240 feet while underwater).</p><p>Additionally, while underwater you gain an exper- tise die on saving throws and weapon attack rolls.</p><h2>Suggested Cultures</h2><p>While you can choose any culture for your dragon- born character, the dragonbound and dragoncult cultures are linked closely with this heritage.</p>","grants":{"5iv7SvNw4zQva9G7":{"grantType":"movement","level":0,"optional":false,"label":"Speed","movementTypes":{"base":["walk"],"options":[],"total":0},"context":{"valueIfOriginalIsZero":"30","isHover":false},"_id":"5iv7SvNw4zQva9G7","default":true,"img":"","bonus":"30","unit":"feet"},"LZm49F4M0iPvEQqY":{"grantType":"feature","level":0,"optional":false,"label":"Gifts","_id":"LZm49F4M0iPvEQqY","default":true,"img":"","features":{"base":[],"options":[{"uuid":"Compendium.a5e.a5e-heritage-features.Item.f5kb19v7zsh64pjv","limitedReselection":true,"selectionLimit":1},{"uuid":"Compendium.a5e.a5e-heritage-features.Item.p3371rivucr08242","limitedReselection":true,"selectionLimit":1},{"uuid":"Compendium.a5e.a5e-heritage-features.Item.l2xbev2gjedrk1f6","limitedReselection":true,"selectionLimit":1}],"total":1}},"KECidOuUeEWIp2ZP":{"grantType":"feature","level":0,"optional":false,"label":"Traits","features":{"base":[{"uuid":"Compendium.a5e.a5e-heritage-features.Item.zviislarfa78nemm","limitedReselection":true,"selectionLimit":1}],"options":[],"total":0},"_id":"KECidOuUeEWIp2ZP","default":true,"img":""},"3GD3wVVIT3QLCzAD":{"grantType":"feature","level":10,"optional":true,"label":"Paragon Gifts","features":{"options":[{"uuid":"Compendium.a5e.a5e-paragon-gifts.Item.qb599o74wfjczvn7","limitedReselection":true,"selectionLimit":1},{"uuid":"Compendium.a5e.a5e-paragon-gifts.Item.7urchbv3furi3g1o","limitedReselection":true,"selectionLimit":1},{"uuid":"Compendium.a5e.a5e-paragon-gifts.Item.jfq4on77hu8czmy3","limitedReselection":true,"selectionLimit":1}],"total":1,"base":[]}}},"source":"adventurersGuide"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"flags":{},"_id":"m95jkl37hhc5u52x"}

Sources of nonmagical healing&nbsp;other than taking a rest have no effect.&nbsp;Magical healing only restores half as&nbsp;many hit points as normal unless you are&nbsp;also repaired in the same round (with an&nbsp;Engineering check, the mending cantrip,&nbsp;or similar).</p><p>In addition, you don&rsquo;t require Supply&nbsp;in the typical sense; instead of eating&nbsp;food, you rely on a specific substance to&nbsp;refuel.

You&nbsp;gain resistance to a specific damage type&nbsp;based on this source.</p><p>Regardless of planarite type, the&nbsp;planar energy contained within allows you&nbsp;to forgo sleep. When you take a long rest,&nbsp;you spend 4 hours in a state of inactivity&nbsp;(instead of sleeping for 6 hours). While&nbsp;powered down in this way, you suffer no&nbsp;penalty to passive Perception.
