You can’t use reactions or speak. Otherwise, you use your statistics. Any items you are carrying transform with you.</p><p>While transformed into a mist, you have a flying speed of 30 feet, can’t speak, can’t take actions or manipulate objects, are immune to nonmagical damage from weapons, and have advantage on saving throws and Stealth checks. You can pass through a space as narrow as 1 inch without squeezing but can’t pass through water. Any items you are carrying transform with you.</p>",
