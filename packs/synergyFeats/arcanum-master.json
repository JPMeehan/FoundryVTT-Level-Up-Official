Whenever you cast a spell that deals damage, you may choose the type of damage that spell deals and the appearance of the spellâ€™s effects. For example, <em>scorching rays</em> made to deal cold damage might look like icicle spears, a <em>fireball</em> that deals radiant damage may appear to be an explosive host of warrior angels, and a <em>lightning bolt</em> that deals psychic damage may be a strange color or accompanied by unnatural howls.</p>",
