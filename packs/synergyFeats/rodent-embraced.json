    "description": "<p><strong><em>Prerequisites</em></strong><em>: Rat Within</em></p><p>You have completely mastered the rat within and learned tricks to make your lycanthropy an even greater asset in combat. You can transform one additional time without suffering a level of fatigue. When you choose to tame the beast in an involuntary transformation, roll 1d8; you gain control over that many hours. While you are transformed, you gain the following features.</p><p><strong>Full Moon Defense</strong>. You gain immunity against slashing, bludgeoning, and piercing damage from weapons that are not magical or silvered.</p><p><strong>Nose for Opportunity</strong>. When an ally strikes a creature you can see with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to move up to your Speed, ending your move adjacent to that creature and making a melee weapon attack against it. If the creature is bloodied and the attack hits, you score a critical hit. Once you have used this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><p><strong>Wererat Trickery</strong>. When you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with a bite attack, you can use your reaction to take the Disengage, Dodge, or Hide action.</p>",
