You learn two maneuvers of your choice from these traditions.</p>\n<p>You gain an exertion pool with 3 exertion points, regaining any spent exertion at the end of a short or long rest. If you already have an exertion pool, it increases by 3. You use your maneuvers by spending points from your exertion pool. The Maneuvers Known column of the Pious Protector table shows when you learn more maneuvers from a tradition you are proficient with, while the Maneuver Degree column shows the highest degree you can select maneuvers from at a given level.</p>\n<p>Additionally, whenever you learn a new maneuver, you can choose one of the maneuvers you know and replace it with another maneuver of the same degree or lower from a tradition you are proficient with.</p>",
