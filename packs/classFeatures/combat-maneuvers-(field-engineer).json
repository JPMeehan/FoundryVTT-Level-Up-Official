You use your maneuvers by spending points from your exertion pool. The Maneuvers Known column of <strong>Table: Martialist Maneuvers</strong> shows when you learn more maneuvers from a tradition you are proficient with, while the Maneuver Degree column shows the highest degree you can select maneuvers from at a given level.</p><p>Additionally, whenever you learn a new maneuver, you can choose one of the maneuvers you know and replace it with another maneuver of the same level from a tradition you are proficient with.</p>",
