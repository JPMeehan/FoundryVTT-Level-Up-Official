As you cast spells, scars and tattoos on your body may disappear, only to return later when you recover your spell points.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Starting at 1st level, you gain the ability to cast spells through pact magic, even though you may not necessarily have a patron. This feature is identical to the warlock pact magic feature with the following changes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You use the Runespell Rager table to determine how many spells and cantrips you know, what level you can cast spells, and how many spell points you have.</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You use the runespell rager spell list instead of the warlock spell list.&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",
