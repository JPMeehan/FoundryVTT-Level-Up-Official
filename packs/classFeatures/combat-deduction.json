If you succeed, choose three of the following items to learn about the creature: Armor Class, vulnerabilities , resistances , immunities , weakest saving throw , or highest ability score. At the narratorâ€™s discretion, you might learn other pertinent details of its combat abilities.</p><p style=\"text-align: start\">After you use this feature on a creature, you cannot attempt it against the same creature until you finish a short or long rest .</p>",
