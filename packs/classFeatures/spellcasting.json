    "description": "<p>Drawing on the power of nature itself, you can cast spells to shape nature’s essence to your will. See Chapter 11: Spellcasting for the general rules of spellcasting and the Spells Listing for the druid spell list.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: start\"><strong>CANTRIPS</strong></h3><p style=\"text-align: start\">At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list. You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Druid table.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: start\"><strong>PREPARING AND CASTING SPELLS</strong></h3><p style=\"text-align: start\">The Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your druid spells. To cast one of these druid spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p><p style=\"text-align: start\">You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p><p style=\"text-align: start\">Casting spells doesn’t remove them from your list of prepared spells.</p><p style=\"text-align: start\">You can change your list of prepared spells whenever you finish a long rest by meditating for at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: start\"><strong>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</strong></h3><p style=\"text-align: start\">Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p><p style=\"text-align: start\"><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p><p style=\"text-align: start\"><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p><h3 style=\"text-align: start\"><strong>RITUAL CASTING</strong></h3><p style=\"text-align: start\">You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: start\"><strong>SPELLCASTING FOCUS</strong></h3><p style=\"text-align: start\">You can use a nature focus as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells.</p>",
