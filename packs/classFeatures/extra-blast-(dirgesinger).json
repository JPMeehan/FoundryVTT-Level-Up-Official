If you know Eldritch Ray, Eldritch Scythe, Eldritch Whip, or Eldritch Disturbance, follow the rules detailed in the Warlock section of the Adventurer&rsquo;s Guide.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you know Eldritch Chant, at 5th level you may target two creatures with one use of Eldritch Chant. This increases to three creatures at 11th level, and four creatures at 17th level. If a creature succeeds on its save against Eldritch Chant, you may target it again with additional uses of Extra Blast.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In addition, when a creature fails its save against Eldritch Chant you may choose to roll one Chant die, expending it. The creature is Confused for a number of rounds equal to the number rolled.</p>",
