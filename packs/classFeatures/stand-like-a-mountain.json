You always have it prepared and it doesn't count against your number of spells prepared. You do not require concentration when casting stoneskin on yourself, and while under the effects of a stoneskin spell you cast you gain a +1 bonus to AC and an expertise die on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws.</p>",
