You may detect magic as the spell. To use this ability, you must make an Arcana check. At a DC of 10 you are aware of magical auras in your area. Should you choose to focus on a specific aura on a following turn, make an Arcana check DC 10 plus the spell level of the magical effect as an action to identify the school of magic it belongs to. This ability does not provide a passive or constant awareness of magical effects.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In addition, you no longer take disadvantage on perception checks due to distance.</p>",
