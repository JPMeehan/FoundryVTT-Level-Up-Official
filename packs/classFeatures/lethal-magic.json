If the target is struck by a spell requiring an attack roll or fails its save against a spell requiring a saving throw, it is also subjected to the effects of the poison. If the poison’s save DC is lower than your spell save DC, it increases to match your spell save DC. Once you have used this ability, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>",
