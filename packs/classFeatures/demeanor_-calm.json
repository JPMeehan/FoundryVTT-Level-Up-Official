		"description": "<p>Knowing how and when to embrace quietude allows your silence to speak far louder than any words, and you easily pick up on the subtleties revealed by body language and demeanor. When you first meet an NPC, you can choose to remain silent and speak through nonvisual cues â€” scrunching your brows, pursing your&nbsp;lips, narrowing your eyes, slowly leaning ever so slightly forward, hunching your shoulders, and so on. As long as you remain silent for 1 minute, the NPC has a CR lower than your level, and it remains within sight of you for the duration, it acts as if you succeeded on an Intimidation check.</p><p>In addition, you gain an expertise die on Insight checks.</p>",
