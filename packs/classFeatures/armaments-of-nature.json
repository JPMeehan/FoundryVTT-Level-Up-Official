You can use an action and expend one use of Channel Divinity to cover yourself in bark, rock, soil, and vines for 1 hour. </p><p>For the duration, your Armor Class equals 10 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier + your Charisma modifier, and when a creature starts its turn and is grappling you, it takes 2d6 piercing damage. </p><p>In addition, you can use a bonus action to grow a melee weapon into your hands. You are proficient with the weapon and it deals 1d12 bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage (determined by the weaponâ€™s shape). While wielding the weapon, your reach increases by 5 feet. The weapon cannot be disarmed, but it can be damaged (AC equal to your herald spell save DC and hit points equal to your herald level).</p>",
