As an action, as long as there is some dead organic material weighing at least 10 pounds around (including soil, bodies, wooden furniture or tools, etc.) you may spend a use of Wild Shape to create a number of edible mushrooms equal to your proficiency bonus. The mushrooms only stay nutritious for a day, but each counts as a unit of Supply and grants a creature that eats it resistance to poison damage and immunity to the poisoned condition for 8 hours.</p>",
