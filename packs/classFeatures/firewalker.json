You are resistant to fire damage, and you treat areas heavily obscured by smoke as lightly obscured and lightly obscured by smoke as clearly visible. Finally, you can walk across the surface of lava as if it were solid ground, not sinking or treating it as difficult terrain, though you still take fire damage as normal (albeit reduced by your resistance).</p>",
