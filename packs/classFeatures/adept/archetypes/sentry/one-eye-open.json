Being asleep does not impede your Perception checks based on senses other than sight or your passive Perception score, and you may choose to wake up in response to any detected stimulus. You can also stand up as a reaction, and if there is an unattended weapon you are proficient with in your space or an adjacent space, you may wield that weapon as part of the same reaction.</p>",
