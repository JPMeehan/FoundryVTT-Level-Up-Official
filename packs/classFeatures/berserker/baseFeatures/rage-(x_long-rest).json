Starting at 1st level, on your turn you can use a bonus action to enter a rage.</span></p><p><span>While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren&rsquo;t wearing heavy armor:</span></p><ul style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; visibility: visible; color: #191813;\"><li style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\"><span>You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.</span></li><li style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\"><span>Every round that you remain in rage, at the start of your turn you gain a number of rage hit points that increases as you gain levels as a berserker, as shown in the Rage Hit Points column of the Berserker table. Whenever you take damage, you reduce your rage hit points first, then your regular hit points. Rage hit points stack each round until your rage ends, at which point they dissipate.</span></li><li style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\"><span>The maximum number of rage hit points you can have at one time is equal to 5 &times; your berserker level.</span></li><li style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\"><span>You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.</span></li><li style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\"><span>If you are able to cast spells, you can&rsquo;t cast them or concentrate on them while raging.</span></li><li style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\"><span>You gain no benefit from temporary hit points.</span></li></ul><p><span>While raging, you cannot choose to use the Fall Back reaction. Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.</span></p><p><span>Once you have raged the number of times shown for your berserker level in the Rages column of the Berserker table, you must finish a long rest before you can rage again.</span></p>",
