On a failure it must choose a different target for its attack or the attack is wasted. An undead that is not mindless is aware of this ability before it tries to attack. If you attack an undead creature, cast a spell targeting it, or cause it to take damage, you lose this protection against that undead creature for the next 24 hours.</p>",
