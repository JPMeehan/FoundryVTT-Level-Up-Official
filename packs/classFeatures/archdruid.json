		"description": "<p>At 20th level, you become an extension of nature. Your Wild Shape has no duration. In addition, when you cast a druid spell you do not need seen or vocalized components, or any material components that have no cost or arenâ€™t consumed by the casting. You gain this benefit in both your normal shape and while using Wild Shape.</p><p>You also learn to tap into the intricate ebb and flow of life around you and how to divert it as you see fit. You may cast the spells <strong>True Ressurection</strong> and<em> </em><strong>Power Word</strong>: <strong>Kill </strong>without expending a spell slot and without any material components. Once you cast either spell in this way, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, you can turn nature in its rawest elements into deadly weapons no matter your form. See the other entries.</p>",
