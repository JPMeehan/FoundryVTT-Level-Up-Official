Whenever you would spend exertion points on a duelist feature or a maneuver from the Mirror’s Glint, Mist and Shade, or Rapid Current combat traditions, you may reduce the exertion point cost of that maneuver or feature by 1 (minimum 0). Once you have used this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.</p>",
