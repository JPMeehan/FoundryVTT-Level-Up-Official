While you are wearing no armor, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Intelligence modifier. You cannot use a shield and still gain this benefit.</p><p>The savant is not proficient in armor by default, but might gain those proficiencies through archetypes, feats, or multiclassing. When you are wearing armor youâ€™re proficient in, you can use your Intelligence in place of your Dexterity to determine your AC.</p>",
