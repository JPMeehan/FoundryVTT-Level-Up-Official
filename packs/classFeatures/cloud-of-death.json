    "description": "<p>At 14th level, your Spore Cloud becomes much more potent. Its radius increases to 30 feet. Creatures that fail their save against the Spore Cloud take 2d4 necrotic damage and have their maximum hit points reduced by the same amount in addition to the other effects. Creatures that succeed on their save still take the damage but do not suffer the reduction to their hit point maximum. The cloud also lightly obscures everything inside it, though you can see through it as if it werenâ€™t there. Creatures suffering from the hallucinations from the cloud treat this as heavily obscured instead. Finally, if a creature fails its save by 5 or more, it is also confused for one minute.</p>",
