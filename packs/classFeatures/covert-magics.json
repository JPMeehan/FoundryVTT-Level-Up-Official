When you cast a spell from the Obscurement school, you may double its normal duration. You may use this ability a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier, recovering all uses upon finishing a short or long rest.</p><p>Also, when given time, you can conceal your spellcasting altogether. When casting a spell, you may make a Deception check to conceal the spellâ€™s origin. A creature attempting to determine where a spell came from must beat the result of this check with a Wisdom (Insight) check to know you cast the spell.</p>",
