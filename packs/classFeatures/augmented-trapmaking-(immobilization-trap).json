When using Trapmaking to create a trap, you can choose to augment it with the new capability, which is triggered when your trap damages a creature.</p><h3><strong>Immobilization Trap</strong></h3><p>The target is caught in the jaws of a trap. The targetâ€™s movement speed is reduced to 0. A creature can use an action or legendary action to make a DC 13 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature on a success. Building this trap requires a hunting trap, which can be recovered after the trap is triggered.</p>",
