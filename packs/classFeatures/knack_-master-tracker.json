You learn all events which transpired in that area in the last 24 hours as though you had witnessed them yourself, although you do not learn secret information not obvious to an observer. The information you gain is only that which would be learned by sight; you do not gain sound-based information or learn what creatures in the area said to each other.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: start\">Once you have used this feature, you canâ€™t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>",
