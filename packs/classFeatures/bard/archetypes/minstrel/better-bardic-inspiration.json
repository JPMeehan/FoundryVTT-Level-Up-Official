When you have granted a creature Bardic Inspiration, if the creature would make a saving throw at the end of its turn to end an effect on it, it can use the Bardic Inspiration to attempt a saving throw at the start of its turn instead.</p><p>In addition, you can use Bardic Inspiration on yourself, but only to make Performance checks.</p>",
