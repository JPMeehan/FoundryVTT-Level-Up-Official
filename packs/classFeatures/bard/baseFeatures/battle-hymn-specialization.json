The range of your battle hymns increases to 60 feet. </p><p>In addition, choose one of the following. </p><p>· You can expend 2 uses of Bardic Inspiration to activate two Battle Hymns at the same time. Losing concentration or changing battle hymns deactivates both. </p><p>· Pick three spells of 4th-level or lower that have only vocalized components. These spells may be from any class spell list. You may spend 2 uses of Bardic Inspiration to cast one of the chosen spells at the start of your turn with no action required (instead of activating a battle hymn). </p><p>· When you expend a use of Bardic Inspiration to activate a battle hymn, you may also grant a Bardic Inspiration die to a creature within 60 feet. </p><p>Whenever you gain a bard level, you may change your Battle Hymn Specialization.</p>",
