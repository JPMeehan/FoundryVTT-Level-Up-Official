Choose one of the following grand battle hymns. </p><p>Beyond the Grave. All allies within 60 feet of you that are bloodied or unconscious are restored to half their maximum hit points. In addition, each is healed of up to 3 levels of fatigue. </p><p>Magic Never Dies. Allies within 30 feet of you regain up to 5 levels of spell slots, or if they have no spell slots, gain 30 temporary hit points. </p><p>Taste of Victory. Allies within 30 feet of you gain a blessing of victory that remains for up to 24 hours or until it is expended. A blessing of victory can be expended while rolling a d20 to gain advantage on an attack roll or opposed ability check. </p><p>Once you have used your grand battle hymn, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.</p>",
