		"description": "<p>At 6th level, you are able to use your Channel Divinity to see and hear through the eyes of another for 1 minute. When using this feature, you become blinded and deafened to your surroundings and sense through a creature you name. As long as the creature is alive and on the same plane of existence, it makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, you can see<br>what it sees and hear what it hears. An unconscious creature automatically fails its save, but only hears (it sees nothing). You cannot see through the eyes of a blinded creature, or hear through the ears of a deafened creature. If the creature is dead or protected from divination magic this feature has no effect. On a successful save, a creature is immune to this feature for 24 hours. <br></p>",
