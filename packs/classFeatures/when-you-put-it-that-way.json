A creature that canâ€™t be charmed is immune to this feature. The course of action must sound reasonable, as with the <em>suggestion </em>spell.</p><p style=\"text-align: start\">If the target fails a Wisdom saving throw , it pursues the course of action you described to the best of its ability for as long as you are present, and for up to 10 minutes after.</p><p style=\"text-align: start\">Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.</p>",
