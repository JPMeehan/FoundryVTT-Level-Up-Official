		"description": "<p>You cope through drink and revelry, and have mastered both. You can gain the benefits of a long rest by spending 4 hours drinking, carousing, and taking the occasional blackout nap. You can carouse in this way so long as you consume at&nbsp;least 4 pint’s worth of ale (or equivalent drink), and you are alert and aware of your&nbsp; surroundings while doing so. If you carouse with another creature in this way, you can attempt to learn secrets from it by drinking it under the table. Each hour you spend carousing with a willing creature, make an opposed Constitution check. On a success, that creature answers a question truthfully (even questions it would not normally answer). </p><p>In addition, you can enjoy alcohol as normal but can’t gain the poisoned condition from it. </p><p>This feature has no effect on creatures that are immune to the poisoned condition.</p>",
