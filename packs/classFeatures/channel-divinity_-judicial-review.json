For one hour, anything that would lead you to the answer to this question is highlighted with a divine glow only you can see. Witnesses or those with relevant knowledge seem to glow faintly, text that contains clues to the questionâ€™s answer appears highlighted on the page, and you automatically notice clues that would help you answer the question you asked.</p><p>This feature merely shows you the location of evidence; securing it and interpreting it are still up to you.</p><p></p>",
