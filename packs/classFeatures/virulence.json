It does not count as an active stance for you, does not cost exertion, and affects any poison you use, not just named ones. If you already had the Virulent Stance maneuver, you may select another Viperâ€™s Fangs maneuver in its place.</p><p>If you would deal poison damage, you can choose to do acid or necrotic damage instead.</p>",
