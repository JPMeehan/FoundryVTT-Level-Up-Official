But when natural processes or bizarre, arcane energies grant a puddle of blood and ichor the spark of life, the puddle evolves into an ooze. Sometimes, the resulting ooze even awakens into sentience, becoming something stranger still: an oozefolk.<br><br>Many Uplanders find oozefolk difficult to look upon. Though they have four limbs and a head like other humanoids, their faces are a conglomeration of strange protuberances shaped into rough facsimiles of eyes, ears, nose, and mouth. Though they can see, hear, and smell as well as any other creature, their features are capable of creating only the most basic expressions. Perhaps most unsettling is the oozefolk&rsquo;s translucent skin&mdash;many a sage has spent decades trying to determine something substantive about the swirl of organs beneath their jelly-like exteriors, and all have definitively failed.</p>",
