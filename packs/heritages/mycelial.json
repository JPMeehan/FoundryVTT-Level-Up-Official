		"description": "<p>According to their legends, mycelials were woven from the hair and melodies of the gods. Before the first morning dawned, they lived beneath the stars and moonlight, delving deep and tasting the many flavors of earth, soil, and stone. When the sun was born, fiery and bright, the mycelials missed its birth, and it&rsquo;s said the sun has never forgiven this slight. While some mycelials do venture to the surface world, most avoid sunlight, preferring instead the cool dark of Underland.<br><br>Mycelials are a small, curious fungus-folk, resembling capped mushrooms with thick legs and dark, pupiless eyes. They eat rock and ore, breaking minerals down with powerful natural acids and collecting hard, inedible crystals and gemstones for trade. They speak in reedy whispers by pushing air through their gills, allowing them to sing beautiful, quiet songs.<br><br>Many Underland creatures regard mycelials asprey. As a result, mycelials tend to be cautious, observing newcomers from a distance before approaching. They use their spore clouds on strangers whose intentions are unknown.</p>",
