		"description": "<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 47\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Planetouched characters are mortal beings whose bloodlines include immortal ancestry. This might be the direct result of those with mortal heritage mating with fiends or angels, or it can be the consequence of a long buried secret &mdash; some people have archdevils lurking in their family trees, while others have been blessed by those they have helped.</p>\n<p>Regardless of their cause however, most plane- touched share a few physical traits with the source of their supernatural bloodline.</p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 47\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<h1>Planetouched Traits</h1>\n<p>Characters with planetouched heritage share the following traits.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Age.</strong></em> Planetouched typically mature at the same rate as humans but have slightly longer life spans. Planetouched born to non-planetouched parents&rsquo; life spans tend to mirror that of their parents&rsquo; heritage.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Size.</strong></em> Planetouched are usually of similar build and size to humans, though those born to non-human parents more closely resemble the heritage of their parents. Your size is Medium, but can be Small with approval from your Narrator.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Speed.</strong></em> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Darkvision. </strong></em>Thanks to your supernatural ancestors, your vision is not impeded by darkened conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You cannot discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Immortal Blessing.</strong></em> Your connection with the source of your bloodline allows you to cheat death. When you would ordinarily be reduced to 0 hit points, you are instead reduced to 1 hit point. You cannot use this trait again until you have finished a long rest.</p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 47\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<h1>Planetouched Gifts</h1>\n<p>Planetouched can vary wildly from each other depending on their bloodline. In addition to the traits granted by your planetouched heritage, select one of the following heritage gifts to determine the nature of your ancestor.</p>\n<h3>Aasimar</h3>\n<p>This heritage of planetouched is created through some sort of divine intervention, or when a bloodline contains celestial blood. These planetouched often have a color scheme that is brighter than those of other heritages, with lots of golds and warm hues being found among them. Their divine blood also twists their features into something frighteningly angelic, resulting in horns that resemble halos or headdresses, and occasionally even planetouched with extra sets of eyes. You have the following traits:</p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 48\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><em><strong>Celestial Legacy.</strong></em> You know the <em>guidance</em> cantrip. In addition, you can use an action to touch a willing creature and restore a number of hit points equal to your level. Once you use this trait, you must finish a long rest before doing so again.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Divine Protection. </strong></em>You have resistance to radiant damage.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Language.</strong></em> You have an innate ability to recognize Celestial, and are able to speak, read, write, and sign it.</p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 48\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<h3>Tiefling</h3>\n<p>The most common reason for planetouched born to nonmagical parents is having an archdevil somewhere in the family tree. Tieflings can be spotted by the horns growing from their skulls and they often have skin colored like their fiendish ancestors, some also smelling faintly of sulfur or brimstone. You have the following traits:</p>\n<p><em><strong>Hellish Resistance.</strong></em> You have resistance to fire damage.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Infernal Legacy.</strong></em> You know the <em>produce flame</em> cantrip. Once you reach 3rd level, you can cast <em>arcane riposte</em> (fire damage only) once per long rest. At 5th level, you can cast <em>heat metal</em> without material components once per long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells.</p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 48\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<h1>Paragon Gift</h1>\n<p>When you reach 10th level, you are an exemplar of the planetouched, and you gain one of the following features.</p>\n<h3>Ancestral Resistance</h3>\n<p>Your bloodline makes you immune to a single damage type.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Aasimar:</strong></em> You gain immunity to radiant damage.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Tiefling:</strong></em> You gain immunity to fire damage.</p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 48\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<h3>Hellish Assault</h3>\n<p>All fire damage you deal ignores resistance. If a creature is immune to fire damage, it instead takes half damage.</p>\n<h3>Radiant Assault</h3>\n<p>All radiant damage you deal ignores resistance. If a creature is immune to radiant damage, it instead takes half damage.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 48\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<h1>Planetouched Culture</h1>\n<p>Planetouched are a rare heritage and many of their kind find themselves in a culture with very few people quite like them. This is particularly the case for planetouched with infernal bloodlines. Still, planetouched have organized to form cultures of their own &mdash; in fact on some worlds there are entire human cultures that became planetouched en masse.</p>\n<p>As the origins of planetouched are diverse so too are their lifestyles. Planetouched are much more likely than any other heritage to adopt another culture, since planetouched are often diaspora communities. Integration and assimilation into another culture is not always easy for planetouched, and they typically opt to form enclaves so they can define themselves on their own terms.</p>\n<h3>Suggested Cultures</h3>\n<p>While you can choose any culture for your plane- touched character, the following cultures are linked closely with this heritage: circusfolk, forsaken, lone wanderer, steamforged.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
