		"description": "<p>With no facial features except pupil-less white eyes and a slash of a mouth, doppelgangers strike onlookers as uncanny in their blankness. However, doppelgangers are rarely seen in their true form.<br><br>Doppelgangers are shapechangers who can adopt the appearance of humanoids of any heritage or gender. While most doppelgangers can&rsquo;t invent a new identity out of nothing, they can imitate an existing person&rsquo;s voice and features so well that few can tell the difference between a doppelganger and the person it mimics. What&rsquo;s more, doppelgangers possess a preternatural sense for what other people are thinking, an intuition that eventually develops into the ability to magically read the thoughts of other creatures.<br><br>Like all people, doppelgangers aren&rsquo;t inherently evil, but powerful temptations lead some astray. When circumstance forces them to imitate another&rsquo;s face, doppelgangers have the opportunity to slip into that person&rsquo;s life, gaining the benefits of their property and privilege. Once they have done so, they must flee to evade detection&mdash;or eliminate the original and keep their life for themselves. Although some doppelgangers follow this path, others use a borrowed face to create a new self. Still others become adventurers, using their abilities to fight monsters and uncover dark secrets. Doppelgangers who resist the temptation to steal identities possess a quiet heroism that few truly appreciate.</p>",
