		"description": "<p>Those unfamiliar with rockborn believe they are nothing more than quirky earth elementals. While motionless, they are sometimes mistaken for statues, or perhaps the remains of an adventurer petrified long ago. Though obviously born from the rock, the true history of these people is more complicated. Some believe that rockborn formed at the center of the earth at the dawn of time; at the very least, they have been around long enough to witness the rise and fall of untold empires.<br><br>In their natural forms, rockborn do indeed resemble earth elementals. However, those keen to fit in among Uplanders sometimes endure a lengthy procedure in which parts of their bodies are chiseled away until they resemble the people of the society they seek to enter. Even the most slender rockborn is heavier than the stoutest dwarf, and though they appear brittle, they are rarely so. An individual rockborn&rsquo;s skin tone often varies, like the striations found in stone. Their facial features, however, tend to settle into a single expression as they age. A reflective and dour rockborn appears sad on their deathbed, while a jovial one meets eternal rest with a smile on their face.</p>",
