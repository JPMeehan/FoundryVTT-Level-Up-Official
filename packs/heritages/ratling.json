		"description": "<p>Ratlings are intelligent, rodent-like humanoids with gray, black, brown, or white fur and naked pink tails. They walk upright and from a distance could even be mistaken for halflings&mdash;if one overlooks their narrow snouts, long whiskers, and sharp, protruding teeth.<br><br>With twitchy reflexes and relatively short lifespans, ratlings tend to value quick thinking over careful deliberation. A plan seldom survives contact with a ratling. A sudden inspiration or temptation can inspire impromptu &ldquo;improvements&rdquo; that alter a scheme beyond recognition. Those not comfortable with improvisation are well advised to avoid ratling partners.<br><br>Ratlings&rsquo; origins are not clear, although historical record suggests that they came into being relatively recently&mdash;perhaps only a few hundred years ago. Some believe that ratlings originated as giant rats in wizards&rsquo; laboratories, although this theory is often advanced along with a demand that the local wizard make amends for ratling thefts. Another theory holds that ratlings are the descendants of wererats. Certainly, ratlings sometimes share the sewers with wererats and are often mistaken for them. Most ratlings believe a third story, speaking of a long-ago rat hero whose mighty deeds earned the approval of the gods and was elevated to a demigod before becoming the ancestor of all ratling peoples.<br><br>&nbsp;Whether the scions of arcane experiments, lycanthropic bloodlines, or a semi-divine hero, ratlings owe nothing to their progenitors. Often disrespected by larger folk, they make sure to take the food and the space they feel is due to them.</p>",
