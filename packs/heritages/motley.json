		"description": "<p>Most people assume a motley&rsquo;s appearance is the result of some ancient curse, a horrible experiment, or the vestiges of wild magic running through their veins. Perhaps all these theories are correct. Whatever their true origins, today motley are not merely a haphazard collection of unfortunate individuals&mdash; as their varied physiologies might suggest&mdash;but a heritage of their own.<br><br>While every motley has a head, two legs, and a pair of arms, that is where their similarities end. At least one of a motley&rsquo;s arms always ends in a humanoid hand, but the others are those of different creatures&mdash;a gazelle&rsquo;s leg, a bear&rsquo;s forearm, and the like. Likewise, their faces are a patchwork of flesh taken from various beasts. Given a motley&rsquo;s startling appearance, other people are usually shocked when a motley utters words instead of chittering or growling.</p>",
