Alternatively, as an action, you can splash the contents of this pot up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged weapon attack against a creature within 20 feet, treating the paint pot as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target is covered in bright paint. The paint can only be removed with at least 1 minute of vigorous scrubbing. While covered in paint, a creature has disadvantage on Stealth checks.</p>",
