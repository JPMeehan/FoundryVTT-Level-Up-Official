		"description": "<p>The mind of a&nbsp;<span class=\"freelinking-link\">rockborn</span> can&rsquo;t help but wander to the question of what they are and where they came from. As patient appreciators of time, rockborn know well the value of coordinated effort, so it&rsquo;s only natural for them to join together into a community. Carven societies dedicate themselves to carving the legends of their people into underground natural formations. Anyone with a passion for history or an appreciation for stonework is welcomed into their fold, as the more hands they have to carve the rock, the closer they come to the truth. Carven communities hold different beliefs about the origins of the rockborn, each vying for more adherents and more evidence to support their claims. Some think they are elementals born from errant magic, others that they are the literal children of the planet. Still others believe that rockborn are statues bestowed with life by the Forge God or the creations of forgotten dwarven empires from eons ago.</p>",
