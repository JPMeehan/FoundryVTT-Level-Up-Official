		"description": "<p>The Faceless is a collective of doppelgangers and other shapechangers who share information and defend each other from harm.</p>\n<p>The Faceless come from all walks of life, counting among their number thieves, adventurers, merchants, and even royalty. Each knows the true identities of those in their immediate circle, as well as the names of a few far-flung Faceless. Every Faceless swears to never knowingly hurt or expose their fellows. Beyond that, they share no common goals, and indeed their aims may even be opposed. A Faceless conclave that shelters doppelganger con artists may also include a skinchanger druid that disapproves of their deceptions, even as they protect the doppelgangers&rsquo; lives and false identities.</p>\n<p>With each member able to adopt many guises, a Faceless enclave naturally becomes a storehouse of secrets. Members of a Faceless community often share these secrets, as well as the magical tricks they use to protect their identities.</p>",
