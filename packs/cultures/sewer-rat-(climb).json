		"description": "<p>Sewer rats are ratlings who live by their wits in the most inhospitable parts of cities. They venture out at night in search of food and other necessities, stealing whatever they can&rsquo;t scavenge. Able to wriggle through tiny spaces and laughing at locks, sewer rats operate much like a thieves&rsquo; guild&mdash;albeit one more interested in food than riches.</p>\n<p>Sewer rats make no distinction between scavenging from garbage piles and stealing from bakeries and warehouses. If something&rsquo;s not being used, it&rsquo;s fair game. It&rsquo;s hard to keep rats out of a storeroom, especially if the rats have nimble brains, access to thieves&rsquo; tools, and more than a passing familiarity with magical defenses.</p>\n<p>When sewer rats do take something valuable, they&rsquo;re happy to return it. Tolerant cities sometimes host a &ldquo;sewer rat bazaar&rdquo; where owners of stolen items can reclaim their property in exchange for colorful feathers or sweet treats.</p>\n<p>While most sewer rats are ratlings, any humanoid willing to turn their back on polite society may be welcomed into a sewer rat enclave. Fugitives, exiles, and orphans alike can find companionship among a ratling family.</p>",
