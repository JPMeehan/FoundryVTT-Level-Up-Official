They know Underland is full of dangers, and thus approach unfamiliar creatures and people with considered care.</p>\n<p>Mycelials maintain a strong oral tradition focused on passing on their songs and stories. They engage in trade with other peoples, exchanging the gems they uncover while eating softer ores for whatever they might need.</p>",
