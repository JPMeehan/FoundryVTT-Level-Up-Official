		"description": "<p>Only the brave or foolhardy dare even the briefest foray into Underland, and few survive such treks long enough to make a habit of it. Underlanders are survivors through and through, having known the leanest of times in tunnels home to monsters and deadly traps alike. The harshness of subterranean life makes Underlanders extremely cautious about whom they trust, but once they form a bond with someone, their loyalty is ironclad. At the same time, Underlanders can be incredibly patient when danger is near&mdash;but when the moment to strike is at hand, theirs is sure.</p>",
