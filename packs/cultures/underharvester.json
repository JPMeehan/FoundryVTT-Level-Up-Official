		"description": "<p>One of the most difficult aspects of life in Underland is finding enough food to eat&mdash;or protecting what food one can find. An underharvester is someone who&rsquo;s mastered the practice of gathering food in the harshest of environments, learning by painful experience (or wise lessons) what food is safe to eat. Mushrooms in particular are a valuable resource for underharvesters, something they take with them whenever they travel to a new area. Whiling away so many hours in the quiet darkness makes underharvesters an introspective lot, as does their penchant for using mushrooms to make their lives more enjoyable. underharvesters use mushrooms in ways many others find quite odd, from mildly poisoning themselves to stay warm in the subterranean cold, filling their bellies with mushrooms with no nutritional value in order to stave off hunger pangs, or ingesting hallucinogenic spores for recreation or religious purposes.</p>",
