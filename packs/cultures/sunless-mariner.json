		"description": "<p>The oceans of Underland are sailed by an eclectic mix of merchants, pirates, explorers, adventurers, and agents of the various underground factions. While less affected by extreme weather than their surface counterparts, these subterranean seas possess hazards of their own, and those who sail them (and survive) are made resourceful and resilient indeed. Sunless mariners spend most of their lives on (or under) the water, operating boats and submarines on the shipping lanes that link Underland&rsquo;s ports. Crews of sunless mariners are sometimes all one heritage, but more often they are an eclectic mix of the people who make their homes underground. Elves, grimlocks, gnomes, dwarves, ratlings, and many others live side by side on these vessels, combining their talents to prevail against the unforgiving depths.</p>\n<p>Unlike surface-world sailors, sunless mariners always know how to swim. It is not uncommon for a contingent of mariners to swim alongside their vessel, hauling it with ropes through narrow passages. Many ships that sail the sunless seas feature airlock-like chambers or magical fields that allow humanoids to enter the ship beneath the water.</p>",
