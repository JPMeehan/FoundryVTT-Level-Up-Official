Until the spell ends you have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons, and on each of your turns you can use an action to make a melee spell attack against a target within 5 feet that deals 4d8 force damage on a successful hit.</p><p>For the duration, you cannot cast other spells or concentrate on other spells. The spell ends early if your turn ends and you haven't attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end this spell early on your turn as a bonus action.</p><p><strong><em>Cast at Higher Levels.</em></strong> When using a spell slot of 5th- or 6th-level, the damage increases to 5d8.</p><p>When using a spell slot of 7th- or 8th-level, the damage increases to 6d8. When using a spell slot of 9th-level, the damage increases to 7d8.</p>",
