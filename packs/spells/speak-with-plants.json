    "description": "<p>Your voice takes on a magical timbre, awakening the targets to limited sentience. Until the spell ends, the targets can communicate with you and follow simple commands, telling you about recent events including creatures that have passed, weather, and nearby locations.</p><p>The targets have a limited mobility: they can move their branches, tendrils, and stalks freely. This allows them to turn ordinary terrain into difficult terrain, or make difficult terrain caused by vegetation into ordinary terrain for the duration as vines and branches move at your request. This spell can also release a creature restrained by an entangle spell.</p><p>At the Narrator's discretion the targets may be able to perform other tasks, though each must remain rooted in place. If a plant creature is in the area, you can communicate with it but it is not compelled to follow your requests.</p>",
