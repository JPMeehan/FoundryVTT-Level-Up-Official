		"description": "<p>A weapon formed from the essence of Hell appears in your hands. You must use two hands to wield the weapon. If you let go of the weapon, it disappears and the spell ends.</p><p>When you cast the spell, choose either a flame fork or ice spear. While the spell lasts, you can use an action to make a melee spell attack with the weapon against a creature within 10 feet of you.</p><p>On a hit, you deal 5d8 damage of a type determined by the weapon's form. On a critical hit, you inflict an additional effect.</p><p>In addition, on a hit with the infernal weapon, you can end the spell early to inflict an automatic critical hit.</p><p><strong>Flame Fork.</strong> The weapon deals fire damage.</p><p>On a critical hit, the target catches fire, taking 2d6 ongoing fire damage.</p><p><strong>Ice Spear. </strong>The weapon deals cold damage. On a critical hit, for 1 minute the target is slowed.</p><p>At the end of each of its turns a slowed creature can make a Constitution saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p><p>A creature reduced to 0 hit points by an infernal weapon immediately dies in a gruesome fashion.</p><p>For example, a creature killed by an ice spear might freeze solid, then shatter into a thousand pieces. Each creature of your choice within 60 feet of the creature and who can see it when it dies must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, a creature becomes frightened of you until the end of your next turn.</p>",
