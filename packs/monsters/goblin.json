			"bio": "<h2>Combat</h2><p>Goblins attack only when they outnumber their opponents. They employ ambush, firing arrows from hiding and then using Nimble Escape to hide elsewhere. When they can, they turn an aspect of the battle to their advantage, attacking in darkness or from above or amongst traps and hazards. If a goblin is engaged in melee while not in an advantageous position, it attacks with its shortsword and then disengages. Unless a powerful leader forces them to stand their ground, goblins retreat once they no longer outnumber their enemy.</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><h2>Goblin Names</h2><p>Blacktooth, Briarbones, Dinda, Flea, Flundercork, Grimgargle, Gurp, One-Toe, Ood, Skirn, Thrunk, Vivvle</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><h2>Legends and Lore</h2><p>With a History or Nature check, characters can learn the following:</p><p><strong>DC 10</strong> Goblins are small humanoids. While many find them disgusting, they are clever and resourceful creatures.</p><p><strong>DC 15</strong> Goblins rarely attack unless they outnumber their foes. For every goblin you see, there are usually two more lurking nearby.</p><p><strong>DC 20</strong> Goblins sometimes serve larger humanoids or train giant rats as watchdogs or mounts.</p><p>Description</p><p>From the wildest forests to the most sprawling metropolises, there's no place in the world you won't find goblins. For these small, individually weak creatures, survival is the greatest virtue.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>It's A Living.</em></strong> Life is unfair to goblins. It's the one thing they can count on. Goblins are rarely granted mercy or kindness by larger folk, and in return they rarely extend it to others.&nbsp;</p><p>Goblins are often found in the service of more powerful creatures, particularly larger goblinoids such as hobgoblins . When faced with impossible tasks or unfair expectations, goblins grumble and complain, plot petty revenge, then roll up their sleeves and get to work. Where other creatures might turn up their noses at disgusting, cramped environments, goblins see opportunity. They will carve out space where none exists, flourishing in the cracks of civilization or in the unforgiving wilderness.</p><p><strong><em>Expert Opportunists.</em> </strong>Goblins often lurk in civilization’s liminal spaces: in abandoned mines within raiding distance of a village, or in a sprawling sewer beneath a city. Goblins can find a use for almost anything, from broken or discarded gear to abandoned tunnels to the rotting husks of long-dead trees. Goblin equipment is frequently scavenged or crafted out of unlikely materials. Goblins rarely risk combat, except when they are certain they have the upper hand. They will gladly take your discarded food, however—and, if you're not careful, whatever's on your table and in the bag you left unattended, as well.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>Feral Glee.</em> </strong>Goblins take their joy wherever they can find it. An unsupervised moment to play is a prize they cherish more than food or treasure.

Humans and elves are humanoids, and so are orcs and goblins. Humanoids may employ magic but are not fundamentally magical—a characteristic that distinguishes them from bipedal, language-using fey, fiends, and other monsters. Humanoids have no inherent alignment, meaning that no humanoid ancestry is naturally good or evil, lawful or chaotic.</p>",

			"privateNotes": "<div>\n<h2>COMBAT</h2>\n<p>Goblins attack only when they outnumber their opponents. They employ ambush, firing arrows from hiding and then using Nimble Escape to hide elsewhere. When they can, they turn an aspect of the battle to their advantage, attacking in darkness or from above or amongst traps and hazards. If a goblin is engaged in melee while not in an advantageous position, it attacks with its shortsword and then disengages. Unless a powerful leader forces them to stand their ground, goblins retreat once they no longer outnumber their enemy.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>GOBLIN NAMES</h2>\n<p>Blacktooth, Briarbones, Dinda, Flea, Flundercork, Grimgargle, Gurp, One-Toe, Ood, Skirn, Thrunk, Vivvle</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>LEGENDS AND LORE</h2>\n<p>With a History or Nature check, characters can learn the following:</p>\n<p>DC 10 Goblins are small humanoids. While many find them disgusting, they are clever and resourceful creatures.</p>\n<p>DC 15 Goblins rarely attack unless they outnumber their foes. For every goblin you see, there are usually two more lurking nearby.</p>\n<p>DC 20 Goblins sometimes serve larger humanoids or train giant rats as watchdogs or mounts.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>From the wildest forests to the most sprawling metropolises, there's no place in the world you won't find goblins. For these small, individually weak creatures, survival is the greatest virtue.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It's A Living. Life is unfair to goblins. It's the one thing they can count on. Goblins are rarely granted mercy or kindness by larger folk, and in return they rarely extend it to others.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Goblins are often found in the service of more powerful creatures, particularly larger goblinoids such as hobgoblins. When faced with impossible tasks or unfair expectations, goblins grumble and complain, plot petty revenge, then roll up their sleeves and get to work. Where other creatures might turn up their noses at disgusting, cramped environments, goblins see opportunity. They will carve out space where none exists, flourishing in the cracks of civilization or in the unforgiving wilderness.</p>\n<p>Expert Opportunists. Goblins often lurk in civilization&rsquo;s liminal spaces: in abandoned mines within raiding distance of a village, or in a sprawling sewer beneath a city. Goblins can find a use for almost anything, from broken or discarded gear to abandoned tunnels to the rotting husks of long-dead trees. Goblin equipment is frequently scavenged or crafted out of unlikely materials. Goblins rarely risk combat, except when they are certain they have the upper hand. They will gladly take your discarded food, however&mdash;and, if you're not careful, whatever's on your table and in the bag you left unattended, as well.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Feral Glee. Goblins take their joy wherever they can find it. An unsupervised moment to play is a prize they cherish more than food or treasure. It may not last long, but goblins can make a game out of anything, and they respond well to anyone who plays along.</p>\n</div>"
