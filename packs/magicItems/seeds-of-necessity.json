		"description": "<p><em>Wondrous</em></p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><p>In the groves of particularly friendly and sociable druids the plants themselves become helpful and eager to please, their valuable seeds able to grow into whatever shape is required.</p><p>A pouch of seeds of necessity contains 1d10 coin-sized seeds. When you plant one of these seeds in soil and water it while you picture in your mind an object which you desire, over the course of one minute the seed grows into a simple wooden object no larger than a 10-foot-cube that closely matches the picture in your mind (common uses include a ladder, a sturdy table, a throne, a barrel, a cart wheel, or a rowboat).</p><p>The seed is consumed as it grows into the object. The seed cannot grow into an object with moving parts, but several seeds can be grown into a combination of objects which could be used to construct a more complicated shape, such as a cart made from a tray with four wheels, or a row boat and two oars.</p><p>When you plant and water a seed of necessity, roll a d100.</p><p>On a result of 100, instead of the object you requested, a friendly awakened shrub grows in its place. On a result of 13 or less, the seed was a bad seed and instead grows into a hostile awakened tree</p>",
