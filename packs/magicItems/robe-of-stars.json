You gain the following benefits while attuned to and wearing the robe:<br>• A +1 bonus to saving throws<br>• You can use an action to shift to the Astral Plane along with everything you are wearing and carrying. You remain there until you use an action to return, appearing either in the space you last occupied or the nearest unoccupied space.<br>• Up to 6 times each day, you can use an action to pull a star from the robe to cast <em>magic missile</em> (as a 5th-level spell). </p><p>At dusk [[/r 1d6 #stars]] removed stars reappear.</p>",
