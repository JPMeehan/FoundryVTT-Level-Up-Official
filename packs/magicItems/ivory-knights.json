		"description": "<p>These two ivory figurines look as though they belong with a chess set. If you and one other person hold one of the knights, you can use an action to whisper in the ear of the game piece to communicate with the creature holding the other (as the <em>message</em> cantrip). </p><p>If you and the person carrying the other figurine hold your game pieces to your hearts while within 120 feet of each other, you share a remembrance of two outmatched knights rushing into battle. Within the next minute, each of you can use an action once to teleport to any point between your current positions. You each can teleport once, after which the figurines lose their power.</p>",
