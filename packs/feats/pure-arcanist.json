    "description": "<p>As a mystic arcanist studies and meditates, they come closer and closer to an understanding of the pure magic from which all other arcanum stems. You gain the following special manifestations:</p><p><strong><em>Divine (Radiant).</em></strong> When you cast a spell that deals radiant damage, you can spend 1 sorcery point and choose one creature you can see within 60 feet. That creature regains a number of hit points equal to 1d8 × the spell’s level.</p><p><strong><em>Pure Arcanum (Force). </em></strong>When you cast a spell that deals force damage, you can spend 2 sorcery points and choose one creature you can see. After the spell’s damage is resolved, if the creature was damaged by the spell it makes an Intelligence saving throw or becomes stunned until the end of its next turn.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",
