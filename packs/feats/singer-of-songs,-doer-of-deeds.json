An allied creature has a critical hit range with melee weapon attacks equal to that granted by your crushing blows ability. If they already have an equal or greater critical hit range with melee weapon attacks, they instead increase their critical hit range by 1 to a maximum of 17-20. When a creature under the effects of this battle hymn critically hits with a melee weapon, they may apply one of your Furious Critical effects. If you start your turn raging, you may sustain this battle hymn without expending any additional uses of Bardic Inspiration.</p>\n<p>In addition, if you critically hit with a melee weapon attack while raging, you regain an expended use of bardic inspiration.</p>",
