You gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Your Sneak Attack die increases by one step against your Studied Adversaries to a maximum of d10.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>While you are hidden, you may teleport up to your movement speed to an unoccupied space you can see. Once you have used this ability a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier, you can&rsquo;t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",
