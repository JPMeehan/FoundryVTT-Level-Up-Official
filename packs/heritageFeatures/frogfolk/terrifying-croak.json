You gain the following benefits:</p>\n<p><strong>Terrifying Croak. </strong>You can use an action to emit a loud and horrifying croak. Enemy creatures within 30 feet who can hear you must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + either your Constitution or Charisma modifier) or become frightened of you for 1 minute. Creatures with a CR at least 3 higher than your level have advantage on this saving throw, and creatures with a CR at least 3 lower than your level have disadvantage. Creatures that succeed at this save cannot be affected again by it for 24 hours. Once you use this trait, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>",
