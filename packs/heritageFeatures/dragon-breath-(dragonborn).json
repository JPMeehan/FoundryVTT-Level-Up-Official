		"description": "<p>Drawing upon great reservoirs of draconic power, you can unleash magical destruction upon your foes. You can use your dragon breath as an action.</p><p>Choose the type of damage dealt by your breath weapon from the following list: acid, cold, fire, force, lightning, necrotic, poison, psychic, radiant, or thunder.</p><p>Additionally, choose between a 30-foot line that is 5 feet wide or a 15-foot cone for the area that your breath weapon affects. Each creature in the breath’s area makes a Dexterity saving throw . If your breath weapon deals psychic damage, a Wisdom saving throw is made instead of Dexterity; if cold, necrotic, poison, radiant, or thunder, a Constitution saving throw . The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus.</p><p>A creature takes 2d6 damage on a failed saving throw, and half damage on a success. The damage increases to 3d6 at 4th level, 4d6 at 9th level, 5d6 at 14th level, and 6d6 at 19th level.</p><p>After you use your dragon breath, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest</p>",
