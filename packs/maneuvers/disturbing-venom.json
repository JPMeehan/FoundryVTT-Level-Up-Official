		"description": " Expend a dose of basic poison as part of a melee weapon attack. On a hit, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw, and on a failed save takes an additional 2d6 points of psychic damage and suffers a level of strife. A creature that succeeds on its save takes half damage and does not suffer a level of strife. If this would result in the creature having levels of strife that exceed your proficiency bonus the creature is frightened for one minute instead. A frightened creature may repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.</p>",
