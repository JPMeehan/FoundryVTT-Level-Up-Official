Your signature remains on a creature until it is fully healed and has taken a long rest.</p><p>While a creature bears your signature, you can use a bonus action to try to intimidate it. The creature makes a Wisdom saving throw against your maneuver DC or becomes frightened of you until the start of your next turn.</p>",
