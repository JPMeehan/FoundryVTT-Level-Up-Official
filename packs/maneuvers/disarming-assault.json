Until the start of your next turn, your strikes can deprive foes of their armaments. In addition to dealing damage, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack it makes a Strength saving throw. On a failure, an item of your choice that the creature is holding (including a shield) flies from its grip to land in a randomly determined space 10 feet away.</p>",
