		"description": "<p>A 5-foot-diameter sphere of fire appears within range, lasting for the duration. It casts bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for another 20 feet, and ignites unattended flammable objects it touches.</p><p>You can use a bonus action to move the sphere up to 30 feet. It can jump over pits 10 feet wide or obstacles 5 feet tall. If you move the sphere into a creature, the sphere ends its movement for that turn and the creature makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. A creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of the sphere makes a Dexterity saving throw against the sphere's damage.</p><p><strong><em>Cast at Higher Levels.</em></strong> The damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.</p><hr class=\"a5e-rule u-my-md\"><p><strong>Rare: Chariot Flaming Sphere.</strong> If you are Medium or smaller you can use 5 feet of your movement to enter or exit the sphere. While inside, you canâ€™t be harmed by the sphere, you move with it when it moves, and creatures take 1d4 fire damage when they hit you with a melee attack.</p>",
