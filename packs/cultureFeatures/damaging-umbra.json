Once on each of your turns while this umbra is active, you can deal extra damage of the type dealt by your Dragon Breath to one target when you deal damage to it with an attack or a spell. The extra damage equals half your level (minimum 1). If you are not dragonborn, you may choose the damage type dealt by your umbra from those available in the Dragon Breath trait.</p>",
