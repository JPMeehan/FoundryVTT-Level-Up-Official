		"description": "<p>People call you a con artist, but you&rsquo;re really an entertainer. You make people happy&mdash;the separation of fools and villains from their money is purely a pleasant side effect.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>What is your most common con? Selling fake magic items? Speaking to ghosts? Posing as a long-lost relative? Or do you let dishonest people think they&rsquo;re cheating you?</p>\n<hr>\n<p class=\"Indent1\"><strong>Ability Score Increases:</strong>&nbsp;+1 to Charisma and one other ability score.</p>\n<p class=\"Indent1\"><strong>Skill Proficiencies: </strong>Deception, and either Culture, Insight, or Sleight of Hand.</p>\n<p class=\"Indent1\"><strong>Tool Proficiencies:</strong>&nbsp;Disguise kit, forgery kit.</p>\n<p class=\"Indent1\"><strong>Suggested Equipment (Cost 41 gold):&nbsp;</strong>Common clothes, disguise kit, forgery kit.</p>\n<p class=\"Indent1\"><strong><em>Feature: Many Identities.</em></strong>&nbsp;You have a bundle of forged papers of all kinds&mdash;property deeds, identification papers, love letters, arrest warrants, and letters of recommendation&mdash;all needing only a few signatures and flourishes to meet the current need. When you encounter a new document or letter, you can add a forged and modified copy to your bundle. If your bundle is lost, you can recreate it with a forgery kit and a day&rsquo;s work.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"Indent1\"><strong><em>Adventures and Advancement</em></strong><strong>.&nbsp;</strong>If you pull off a long-standing impersonation or false identity with exceptional success, you may eventually legally become that person. If you&rsquo;re impersonating a real person, they might be considered the impostor. You gain any property and servants associated with your identity.</p>\n<h3><strong>CHARLATAN CONNECTIONS</strong></h3>\n<ol>\n<li>A relentless pursuer: an inspector who you once made a fool of.</li>\n<li>A relentless pursuer: a mark you once cheated.</li>\n<li>A relentless pursuer: a former partner just out of jail who blames you for everything.</li>\n<li>A former partner now gone straight who couldn&rsquo;t possibly be coaxed out of retirement.</li>\n<li>A respected priest or tavernkeeper who tips you off about rich potential marks.</li>\n<li>The elusive former partner who ratted you out and sent you to jail.</li>\n<li>A famous noble or politician who through sheer luck happens to bear a striking resemblance to you.</li>\n<li>The crook who taught you everything and just can&rsquo;t stay out of trouble.</li>\n<li>A gullible noble who knows you by one of your former aliases, and who always seems to pop up at inconvenient times.</li>\n<li>A prominent noble who knows you only under your assumed name and who trusts you as their spiritual advisor, tutor, long-lost relative, or the like.</li>\n</ol>\n<hr>\n<h3><strong>CHARLATAN MEMENTOS</strong></h3>\n<ol>\n<li>A die that always comes up 6.</li>\n<li>A dozen brightly-colored &ldquo;potions&rdquo;.</li>\n<li>A magical staff that emits a harmless shower of sparks when vigorously thumped.</li>\n<li>A set of fine clothes suitable for nobility.</li>\n<li>A genuine document allowing its holder one free release from prison for a non-capital crime.</li>\n<li>A genuine deed to a valuable property that is, unfortunately, quite haunted.</li>\n<li>An ornate harlequin mask.</li>\n<li>Counterfeit gold coins or costume jewelry apparently worth 100 gold (DC 15&nbsp;Investigation&nbsp;check to notice they&rsquo;re fake).</li>\n<li>A sword that appears more magical than it really is (its blade is enchanted with&nbsp;<em>continual flame&nbsp;</em>and it is a mundane weapon).</li>\n<li>A nonmagical crystal ball.</li>\n</ol>",
